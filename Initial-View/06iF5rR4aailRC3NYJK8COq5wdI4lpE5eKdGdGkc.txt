Speaker 0    00:00:00    All right, well, good morning, and thank you for coming in. Could you please state your name?  
Speaker 1    00:00:04    Yeah, my name is Entine. Okay. You can call me Pen, like that name?  
Speaker 0    00:00:09    Panda  
Speaker 1    00:00:10    Pen.  
Speaker 0    00:00:11    <laugh> pen? Yeah. Oh, great. Okay. Pen, not pencil. Pen. Mm-hmm. All right. Well, pen. Um, if you had your own personal mascot, what would it be?  
Speaker 1    00:00:23    Mascot.  
Speaker 0    00:00:24    Do you know what a mascot is? I'm sorry. Okay. A mascot would be, um, a animal human being or object that would, um, be good luck and cheer you on.  
Speaker 1    00:00:39    Oh, yeah. Mm. I really like Panda first. I like, my name is Pan and sounds like Panda. And also I like Panda because it's very cute in animal and it can like people from different countries, different backgrounds will all like Panda because it's so cute. And it's also a present tape of friendship. And I have a lot of like, some toys that like, looks like Panda in my home and I really like them. So, uh, I believe that Panda could be my mess, mess  
Speaker 0    00:01:18    Mascot. That's perfect. No, that, that makes total sense. Yeah. All right. What about if you had the opportunity to either talk to a professor or visit a company or business, where would you wanna go?  
Speaker 1    00:01:33    Well, I would really like to visit the Apple company. You know, that, uh, the com Apples products really impressed me. Like they have the super elegant appearance and user interfaces and they have made very great business success. So I would really like to visit the company to see, um, what makes them to have such a great sense of Esthetics and so good, uh, technology. What,  
Speaker 0    00:02:00    What department would you wanna visit?  
Speaker 1    00:02:02    Like first the, uh, the design department, like to design the, uh, appearance of these iPhones? MacBooks, you know that though, it seems very simple, but I know that there are a lot of charismatics and method that is needed and required to design such a perfect appearance of the, that.  
Speaker 0    00:02:23    What, what are some questions that you would ask them?  
Speaker 1    00:02:29    Like, what's your design idea? Like why some, when you look at some like Chinese phones, you may see that they have a very rough design. Like sometimes you, it can be used, but it doesn't look so appealing. But the Apples, um, product, for example, even the charger can see it's design as a whole and there is no borders, uh, in it. And I believe that it is very unique of Apple Company to be able to have such a perfect design idea. And I would really like to know what cause them to have such an idea and how do they apply it. Mm-hmm. <affirmative>,  
Speaker 0    00:03:13    Is there anything that you'd like to change with your, Do you have an iPhone?  
Speaker 1    00:03:19    I used to have <laugh>.  
Speaker 0    00:03:22    Yeah. Uh, do you have a Mac?  
Speaker 1    00:03:25    I have an air.  
Speaker 0    00:03:26    Do you have any Apple products? Yeah,  
Speaker 1    00:03:28    Of  
Speaker 0    00:03:28    Course. <laugh>. Is there anything that you'd like to change or would you give them suggestions on a, anything that you have?  
Speaker 1    00:03:35    Yeah. One reason is that one change is that I sometimes get really confused about the, a lot of passwords. And sometimes I just, I, there are so many passwords that I need to like, put in when I'm using some services of it. And sometimes I just can't remember the passwords. Well, I know that it is something to deal with promise, and I know Apple do well with protecting users privacy, but the, like, the passwords are just like, bring me driving me crazy. <laugh>,  
Speaker 0    00:04:08    They driving me crazy. Okay. Uh, well next year when you are in college, what will be the first class you'll wanna take?  
Speaker 1    00:04:18    Class? Yeah. Like I am a big fan of science and I would really like to take class about science. Each subject would be okay, like physics, computer science, or engineering. That's so appealing to me that I would really like to take it. Mm-hmm. <affirmative>.  
Speaker 0    00:04:37    Um, when you think about computer science, do you and Apple, do you think that we rely on technology too much?  
Speaker 1    00:04:45    We are rely on technology too much. Do we? Mm Yeah, of course. Like in modern society, we can't give up our phones or internet that will drive us to ancient people. And, uh, but yes, there are some very much advantages of using technology, but sometimes we may rely too much. Like, uh, when, uh, when we are having party or family meeting, we often see people just using their phones and chat with each other instead of chatting face to face. And that's a really rare phenomena. And I think people sometimes rely too much on technology and they don't share much time with their families and friends. Mm-hmm.  
Speaker 0    00:05:24    <affirmative>, what about you? We had, you just had mentioned about your password and how Apple is really, um, secure, but do you, are there risks about all, are information,  
Speaker 1    00:05:37    Risk of information  
Speaker 0    00:05:39    Being, uh, exposed?  
Speaker 1    00:05:41    Mm. Yeah. I think there's sometimes some news that about Apple Company or other like phones company that they may leak the information to someone else or FBI like that. But I know that there's a very serious issue. Um, but it is very difficult to protect some such kind of legal information because if it leaks information to government, we can't rely on governments to solve this problem. So, yeah. So what I do is to minimize my exposure of information on such technology devices. And how  
Speaker 0    00:06:22    Do you do that?  
Speaker 1    00:06:22    Like, when I was like, sometimes, um, some apps applications in the form may ask me for some certain rights to, uh, visit my, uh, personal information. Sometimes I may deny it and refuse it, and then I can't use the application though. But I think that could be safe for me. And also when I'm visiting some shopping websites, I may upload a fake information, like fake name, so a nickname. So they want, uh, so my personal information may not be so easy to be leak.  
Speaker 0    00:07:03    Okay. Uh, and when you think about your phone, what is an app that you can't believe that has not been created?  
Speaker 1    00:07:13    That some app created, but I can't believe what will happen.  
Speaker 0    00:07:17    You can't believe that it hasn't been created,  
Speaker 1    00:07:20    Hasn't been. Hmm. Well, for, as a Chinese, I rely the most on WeChat. Like, um, but  
Speaker 0    00:07:30    Is there anything else that you wish you had on your phone that is not available?  
Speaker 1    00:07:35    Oh, okay. Hmm. I really like the idea of mm, uh, how to say that, uh, like, um, that, um, when you put a camera and the scan it to your surround things, it can create some, um, some fake images on it. Like there is a panda moving on your desk and like there is an enemy figure standing over there. So I really like such technology to be applied to my phone, and I think such an app would really be welcomed by all the student, uh, other people. Mm-hmm.  
Speaker 0    00:08:22    <affirmative>, what kind of, what computer languages, do you know?  
Speaker 1    00:08:25    Um, I studi computer science, like just this year. Oh, okay. I, I, I've studied Python, uh, this summer in culinary summer college. Okay.  
Speaker 0    00:08:35    What about, what's, um, what is maybe an interesting assignment you've completed in physics?  
Speaker 1    00:08:42    In physics? Hmm.  
Speaker 1    00:08:48    I would really like to mention an assignment that I completed both in physics and computer science. Actually, I combined these two together. Yes. Like earlier this year, I, uh, had a course with a professor that meaning, uh, learning about the machine learning and, and, uh, the quantum physics, like, um, you know that in quantum physics, uh, scientist sometimes do some expectation for Muellers. Like for example, they expect the value of the gives free energy only by their experience, and it may take them months and years to work out their formula formula. Like it's not an accurate one. And they just make that formula Mueller based on their experience from the, uh, experiment. What,  
Speaker 0    00:09:34    What was your responsibility? What did you have to do?  
Speaker 1    00:09:36    Yeah, so I designed a program with the professor and it will like, analyze machine learning program. It will analyze all the data from the past experiments and will, will analyze it and work out a and optimize formula for the expectation of gives free energy.  
Speaker 0    00:09:58    So what did you have to do?  
Speaker 1    00:10:00    So, um, like I, I, I, I, I learned something about machine learning and apply it to the physics. And so,  
Speaker 0    00:10:09    But when you showed up in the, when you met the professor, like what did you have to do? What was your responsibility?  
Speaker 1    00:10:14    Um, I, um, I, I design the, um, the, the method of the, uh, to analyze the formula and optimize the formula. So it's like a matrix for the computer to operate, and I design it. So it's based on the, uh, previous papers. Okay. But, uh, I working it by myself.  
Speaker 0    00:10:40    Oh, wow. Now how fast is it able to come up with a formula?  
Speaker 1    00:10:45    Like when you, uh, start to analyze the data? When everything is prepared, it will run for 20 minutes to work out it. And like the scientists in parts before the computer emotion learning is ever discovered, developed. They may take months and years to,  
Speaker 0    00:11:02    Well, how can you, how could you make it so that it would, uh, create the formula in two minutes?  
Speaker 1    00:11:10    Two minutes? Well, um, one way is to improve the hard drive, to improve the CPU or something. Or you can reduce the, um, reduce the amount of, uh, data you want to train this machine learning program, but it will reduce the accuracy of this program. Mm-hmm. <affirmative>. So, yeah.  
Speaker 0    00:11:33    What, what do you think is the future for machine learning?  
Speaker 1    00:11:38    Uh, yeah, it's very interesting. Like Stanford has set up a, an artificial intelligence college independently, but I believe that, um, machine learning should be combined with many other fields, like other subjects. For example, if machine learning is combined with optical engineering, it can produce the perfect aeromatics for the cameras. So the cameras on your phone can choose the best pictures with the help of machine learning. And also when machine learning is combined with, uh, for example, data science mm-hmm. <affirmative>, so it can analyze huge amount of data in very quick time. And that's the power of big data. So I think the future of machine learning licensing is combination with other fields.  
Speaker 0    00:12:26    And what aspect of machine learning would you wanna be involved in? Wow.  
Speaker 1    00:12:33    Hmm. I'm very interested in, um, what is machine learning, and also interested in the, how to say, do  
Speaker 0    00:12:42    You think, um, machine learning could, could you input, uh, emotions into it?  
Speaker 1    00:12:48    Mo emotion? Yeah, that's what I was talking. I I'm very interested in some, um, like social effects of machine learning. Like it's, if it's really been something like's like human beings, like some things that you can see in the films of movies that will cause a lot of problems. Like, and so what  
Speaker 0    00:13:08    About could they learn how to feel guilty?  
Speaker 1    00:13:12    Guilty? So a basic idea is to put the, the function of feeling guilty into that program. So if it has done something bad, it will, the program will let it feel guilty, but I'm not sure if it will really feel guilty.  
Speaker 0    00:13:29    So it couldn't, it wouldn't be able to have a soul.  
Speaker 1    00:13:32    Yeah. So is made by scientist, It's an occupational soul.  
Speaker 0    00:13:38    What else would you like to highlight?  
Speaker 1    00:13:41    Oh, yeah.  
Speaker 1    00:13:45    Uh, what I want to highlight is my difference from other science levels. Like obviously I'm a, I'm in love with science, but I have something to do with it. Like, um, many people just focusing on science and I care nothing more about it. But besides a science level, I'm also an arts level and I really appreciate arts and esthetic. I, there used to be a saying that if the world of science is fully developed and discovered by human beings what humans will still pursue in the world of art and music. And I don't think that it's a really great thing. I believe that art is something more than just on the leisure entertainment for humans. It can really reflect social background and history of the, uh, society. And it can reflect the psychology and the mentality of a single person. And I believe that how much a person appreciate aesthetics can g greatly reflect his or her pursuit for the achievement.  
Speaker 1    00:14:51    Like, uh, I really believe in what America could be created when artists skillfully used in other fields like science and technology, like the Apple company I've just mentioned is a great example of it. And for myself, I really like art. Like I have played, played the piano for more than four years, and a fan of j and Asian music and a cyber punk. So, um, um, so I would really like to combine arts into the daily life and my study in my future, like you can create best user interfaces or in programming, like you can create a beautiful logic behind the physics equation and formulas. So, So  
Speaker 0    00:15:37    Could you add something in machine learning so that it would appreciate art?  
Speaker 1    00:15:42    Yeah, I thought of this like, um, there is some kind of machine learning that can create the paintings. I would be very strange because it was always thought as human beings, creators, but mm, it would really be an amazing technology if it is, uh, finished for machine learning to create human like, uh, pictures and paintings. But it would really cause a lot of social problems. Like, what is Xs? What is art? It's weird. It's created by soulless machine. And yeah, I really think the future of society could be very, very strange.  
Speaker 0    00:16:24    All right. Thank you.  
Speaker 1    00:16:25    Thank you.
