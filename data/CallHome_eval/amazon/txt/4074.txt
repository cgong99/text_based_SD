spk_0:  so anyway how are you doing these days
spk_1:  things are going very well I think I had mentioned before that um that uh that uh there's a company now that I'm working with um uh which is very much just just myself and chris
spk_1:  no you haven't mentioned that Okay okay so you
spk_0:  told me that you were leaving the company that you were at and you were entertaining offers and uh
spk_1:  well well it seems to make sense since I had a client to just kind of set up my own company of sorts So um some things are going extremely well So I had one client who said that he'd pay me a minimum amount you know he there would be a minimum amount of work of about a a day a week for the next 23 years which is sufficient to pay all my bills and so I decided that it would make sense to do this and um
spk_1:  and I've been getting substantially more work than that so I'm quite pleased Quite pleased
spk_0:  Well that's good
spk_1:  So um so I have a bunch of work I need to do on my flat this year I've been telling you that I needed to do that roof for quite some time but it should it should come out this year
spk_0:  Oh well that's good it
spk_1:  should be done in a few months
spk_0:  You're talking a little bit about it at one point
spk_1:  Yeah Yeah
spk_1:  so you have no intentions of coming over this way anytime soon
spk_0:  Um I don't see the finances occurring
spk_1:  for a
spk_0:  while
spk_0:  Um actually right at the moment finances are not going real well but
spk_1:  I'm working
spk_0:  On that one it's
spk_1:  just
spk_0:  uh uh the the main reason for that is I have not really anticipated a few expenses that recently came
spk_1:  up uh
spk_0:  related to a couple of burglaries that I had
spk_0:  Yeah but not a whole lot I can do about that now
spk_1:  to
spk_0:  deal with the situation and so that's what I'm doing But um
spk_0:  anyway uh one of the main reasons that I've been such a pathetic correspondence has been work I've actually been doing a lot of it I turned in my master's thesis back in May and I'm actually presently working on um several uh articles
spk_1:  Oh okay impressive
spk_0:  Yeah actually it turns out that one thing one little
spk_0:  bit and what I was doing uh is going to turn out to be very important in the end
spk_0:  and uh
spk_0:  from what I had been reading in the literature see the one very annoying thing about all of this was my advisor has been in France for a year and a half and this made writing my thesis very annoying because there wasn't much discussion
spk_1:  yep yep yep
spk_0:  um
spk_0:  anyway I had been
spk_0:  kind of telling him that you know from my reading of the literature I thought that this one little alteration I had made in my model was kind of clever and unique
spk_1:  and
spk_0:  it made
spk_0:  the one type of solution occur which was seen experimentally but none of the other models had uh had basically I'm looking at um multi mode lasers And one of the things that they find experimentally are what they call anti phased states where
spk_0:  if you look at the total intensity
spk_1:  the
spk_0:  laser you get an insulation which is characterized by one frequency
spk_1:  Yes Okay
spk_0:  If you look if you separate out the different modes of the laser
spk_1:  and look at
spk_0:  one of those you get more than one frequency
spk_1:  So
spk_0:  what's happening is that the modes are oscillating out of phase so that they completely mask each other's
spk_1:  oscillations
spk_0:  on these other frequencies And
spk_0:  uh
spk_0:  you can with a pretty simple model you can find that frequency in a transient but you can't find that frequency in a driven frequency you can't find so that it will sustain
spk_1:  So
spk_0:  you know that that particular frequency according to most models damps out very quickly And so you shouldn't actually really be able to ever see it
spk_1:  The
spk_0:  only thing is that when you do the experiment you see it
spk_1:  got it got it
spk_0:  So um I found a simple modification of the original formula which unfortunately makes the solutions horrendously nasty and in most cases insoluble but
spk_0:  it gives the driving term
spk_1:  So
spk_0:  it actually creates a situation where you get the right sort of answer you just can't always write it down very easily
spk_1:  Oh wow So so so you're pushing forward the bounds of theoretical laser laser uh whatever it is
spk_0:  but which is kind of interesting considering that that's not really my thing
spk_1:  Indeed indeed being
spk_0:  an experimentalist not a theorist but um
spk_1:  indeed Oh wow Oh impressive So so so so you're gonna get an article in nature or something
spk_0:  Um actually
spk_0:  I'm not sure if we're shooting for I think optics Letters is probably the one that we're shooting for or else perhaps though
spk_0:  I don't think it's quite that significant would be letters
spk_0:  but uh we want to write a letter and then a couple of articles and
spk_0:  I I don't know how much you know about scientific literature but letters are much more prestigious than articles
spk_1:  Oh okay I didn't realize that Yeah
spk_0:  so that's that's why it's actually a big deal You know writing a couple articles based on your master's thesis is not at all unusual and physics and uh it's the fact that I would be writing a letter that is the impressive part of it all And what's actually kind of interesting is I kept telling meal that I thought that this was kind of significant
spk_0:  and Neil kept writing back that I should tone this part of the thesis down that
spk_1:  people
spk_0:  have been seeing you know people see the anti phase motion and it's true they do in the transients and I was having a lot of trouble getting across to him that all of the literature isn't has this frequency in the transient and not driven and uh what happened was after I had turned in my thesis
spk_0:  but before I saw Neil again he went to a conference in Rochester and there this was a big issue among the people who were doing this work was that their models couldn't show this as a driven frequency yet Their experiments showed driven frequency And so Neil then
spk_1:  like a week
spk_0:  later came to Branmar and he said hey low we got to write this up
spk_1:  Exactly I
spk_0:  was like well I've been telling you that deal
spk_0:  So
spk_1:  cool That's cool
spk_0:  That's mostly the sort of stuff that I'm spending a lot of time on now
spk_1:  looking on your C V Your resume so you might as well spend the time
spk_0:  Yes Well no it's definitely worth doing Um and I would have been spending more time on it if it weren't for uh dealing with the burglary
spk_1:  issues have been dealing with So you still living in the house in the middle of the park
spk_0:  Yes And the thing is that this place is incredibly easy to break into if you want to It's not a question of whether or not
spk_0:  Yeah that that was easy it was just that no one really knew it was worth breaking into
spk_1:  Exactly Exactly
spk_0:  And so the problem is that now they found out that it's worth breaking into
spk_0:  unfortunately well it's kind of odd they've stolen very weird things for the most part As far as you know it's like the first time they broke in they what they stole was just bizarre mostly worthless stuff
spk_0:  And uh the most worthwhile thing as far as monetary value in that they stole was the pre amplifier of my stereo Unfortunately because it's a nice pre amplifier it has an off board power supply which they didn't steal which makes the thing that they stole absolutely worthless
spk_0:  Uh
spk_1:  huh
spk_1:  So so so so when they book in the second time did they steal the uh the uh
spk_0:  actually know all they stole the second time was my bike
spk_1:  which
spk_0:  was actually where the major problem came
spk_1:  Exactly I
spk_0:  suddenly had no transportation And so I then had to go bike hunting and eventually get another bike And
spk_1:  that
spk_0:  that cost me a lot of time
spk_0:  spending a lot of time hunting for bikes and
spk_1:  and then
spk_0:  Getting one purchased and then having to go get it and things like that But
spk_0:  that's dealt with at least And so
spk_0:  uh that's
spk_0:  at least dealt with now I just have to work on the financial aspects of all of this But at
spk_1:  least
spk_0:  during the summer I can actually
spk_0:  uh according to the stipulations of my grant or my fellowship I can actually earn money during the summer
