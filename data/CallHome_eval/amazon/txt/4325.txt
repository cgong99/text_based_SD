spk_1:  An English Lit for five weeks and I took them cycle finishing up next week I can't wait
spk_0:  because it's like like
spk_1:  psychology introduction
spk_0:  psychology
spk_1:  sociology is a lot of work
spk_0:  Yeah What kind of sociology It's
spk_1:  just General sociology
spk_0:  Okay
spk_1:  um
spk_1:  You have to record
spk_0:  right
spk_1:  journal write ups and stuff like grab articles in the paper about specific topics I have to write a paper handed in by the end of next week there's a lot of digging information has to go with it
spk_0:  Recycle
spk_1:  just have to say the chapters
spk_0:  my
spk_1:  tests I've got on my test
spk_0:  Good
spk_1:  for that
spk_0:  I know I hate I hate research it's hard very hard and it takes so much time
spk_1:  and uh I've been working up until like last week I hurt my back picking up shanley work the past two weeks
spk_0:  for your kidding
spk_1:  So I'm going back Monday though Thank goodness
spk_1:  Do you
spk_0:  have to go through any physical therapy Yeah
spk_1:  I'm doing that now because yeah I went last week and then I went I'm going three times this week and see the doctor tomorrow Hopefully I'll get a note so I can go back to work on Monday because I have no time to use
spk_1:  you know for sick time and
spk_0:  stuff Yeah because you took time when you had your surgery on your needs too right
spk_1:  exactly I use a lot of it at that time so I have none left whatsoever I had to use in my last two vacation days because they had to make you do that now for some reason which is fairly new which really isn't fair but
spk_0:  what do you mean
spk_0:  because you were out sit or
spk_1:  I've been out all week and I said only 67 hours and I said well just give me the seven hours of six and the eight hours of holiday so I have eight hours worth of pay That's
spk_0:  it I
spk_1:  said don't use my vacation time And she told me she had to
spk_1:  I have like two days
spk_0:  left
spk_1:  Like 16 hours which is going to cover me for at least a couple of days in August so I wouldn't go that check
spk_0:  but
spk_1:  They told me they had to pay me that 16 hours of vacation time
spk_0:  which is
spk_1:  mandatory which I think stinks
spk_1:  I just wanted to get back to work and
spk_0:  back to normal Yeah
spk_1:  I like taking courses and I really like it but I don't like taking summer courses not like two at a time
spk_0:  Yeah so
spk_1:  two chapters for tomorrow I only read one thoroughly and the other one I gotta read and learn
spk_0:  so we got
spk_1:  to go to the library and basically box myself in like a little cubicles and just read it and learn it that
spk_0:  way
spk_1:  so I can't really concentrate with them
spk_1:  totally away from things
spk_0:  like
spk_1:  from home the T V On the other hand I can hear
spk_0:  it right
spk_1:  totally isolated have just everything block everything out away from study Patrick
spk_1:  because I'll I'll read stuff I can read a book but I can't study and I can't block everything out
spk_0:  So you guys are still seeing each other
spk_1:  Yeah it's weird because um after I was really bummed
spk_0:  out
spk_1:  and we talked and stuff and um
spk_1:  I totally missed him and
spk_1:  I mean I was crying on the phone he was crying on the
spk_0:  phone because
spk_1:  you missed me so I miss you already and it was like you know why are we doing this
spk_0:  So
spk_1:  I figured we done
spk_1:  take more time give him some more time and evaluate like six months like in october so we've been seeing each other up until you know we still haven't seen each other Like I don't like go to family things with his
spk_0:  which
spk_1:  is kind of weird and I'm like I wrote him a letter this past week and told him how this is not enough You know I said you know this is gonna happen at some point you have to make a decision either you want us to be together you know Yeah you know my feelings and
spk_1:  that's just the way it has to be so this isn't like it's a new relationship with each other
spk_0:  for
spk_1:  10 years and we've got the good bad and
spk_0:  ugly and
spk_1:  we were still here because we love each other so that should mean something that should show you
spk_1:  Yeah that should that should be significant somehow I think it is but
spk_1:  um we're gonna talk about some stuff on friday and we'll spend the day together Sunday
spk_0:  Is he working now
spk_1:  He got laid off
spk_0:  Did you know that I think I'm not sure
spk_1:  if you get laid off I was laid off from grandma died I think
spk_0:  Yeah I think he was but I don't know he was gonna do something when he got
spk_1:  some money for school
spk_0:  but
spk_1:  he took um english comp minus and I believe he really he's a really
spk_0:  good writer he
spk_1:  really writes from his soul
spk_1:  Um And he's taken of all things animal physiology which is the toughest thing he could take
spk_0:  I know he
spk_1:  having a hard time with it but he's busting his butt and he's he's done some really good grades and some just mediocre grades So he he wanted to prove himself he could do it So he took the hardest thing he had to take forever
spk_1:  next time I will just be doing the A And p of the alcohol abusive person
spk_1:  So he told me today he just got a really well we got 68 and he was so ticked because he made some careless errors he skipped one question and went on to the next But then when he wrote the letters in he put it on that particular one and then we answer that question The other three were just off because they were in the right spot at the last four which were right which you would have a credit for were wrong because he put in the wrong space
spk_0:  he was really
spk_1:  ticked off himself
spk_0:  Is that passing
spk_0:  Yeah
spk_1:  six days passing is passing
spk_0:  Yeah we'll see if there's different scales that people have for grades and sometimes uh that is you know like a I don't know I don't remember how it goes but
spk_1:  it's passing but for some particular programs you have to have at least a C Or better
spk_1:  So I was like you gotta be in english let that was like the first time I read a paper in like eight years
spk_0:  Was that interesting class
spk_1:  I liked it Yeah I didn't like the poetry having an analyst poetry but I
spk_0:  liked
spk_1:  English literature I liked stories I enjoyed that part in that part Once I got the hang of it was okay
spk_0:  My
spk_1:  first paper I gotta stand and I knew the story really well It was intelligently written
spk_1:  but I didn't like dig into it
spk_0:  and
spk_1:  the second paper gotta be minus
spk_1:  and then I didn't really like the author that story either I didn't really understand the story so well
spk_0:  Yeah called
spk_1:  a misfit
spk_1:  and like the author Connery
spk_0:  I've heard of
spk_1:  him
spk_0:  but I've never read
spk_1:  And the 3rd 1 we deal with Hamlet which I love I love shapes there
spk_0:  So I
spk_1:  had to write a
spk_0:  paper hard to understand I think it is because
spk_1:  you have to keep going down the notes and like learning what the words mean and stuff But we also watched the film I got the tape Gibson and
spk_0:  I
spk_1:  watched
spk_0:  that I really
spk_1:  enjoy that kind of thing
spk_0:  I wrote a
spk_1:  good paper and my little pony at the end of it
spk_0:  I had to
spk_1:  be plus I added more to it you know
spk_0:  it
spk_1:  was really it was really well done I really easy for me to write because I had done two before that I just really enjoyed the material I was
spk_0:  working that helps I
spk_1:  got a really good grade on that and I got to be on the course but I worked really hard for it and it wasn't
spk_0:  easy
spk_1:  you know And then
spk_1:  for my test for psychology I'm taking one next tomorrow and went on next Wednesday on my final grade
spk_0:  and
spk_1:  then for my midterm myself sociology a
spk_0:  and
spk_1:  then I'll take my other final next week
spk_0:  so it's
spk_1:  a lot of work
spk_0:  We couldn't take any more classes after this
spk_1:  Yeah I'd like to take um
spk_1:  introduction to our history or take a philosophy and maybe I don't even know if I want to tackle spanish yet
spk_0:  I
spk_1:  have to have a language but I don't really know if I wanna do it now
spk_0:  I think I'm gonna take it do you guys have telling courses or you know what those are
spk_1:  what are
spk_0:  they telling courses it's like you get a video and you just you know watch the video at home and you do your own reading and the work and stuff at home and then you go in
spk_0:  however so often they have a schedule set up to the school and take your test Like in a testing center I'm gonna try that since I took a lot of friends in high school I thought maybe it won't be too hard to do it that way I'm gonna try the
spk_1:  interesting
spk_0:  because we did
spk_1:  um let's
spk_0:  see
spk_1:  study evaluation on us We had to write down in psychology and turned out that I'm a what do you call it
spk_1:  something observer reflective observer when I study when I do things like kind of like sit back and watch and stuff and I I can be very quiet in the class I don't participate a lot in the class and I pay attention I'm always there
spk_0:  They
spk_1:  don't like to say a lot of stuff
spk_0:  Yeah
spk_1:  not in the psychology class I don't I just don't feel comfortable with it
spk_1:  like with the people that are in
spk_0:  there Yeah so
spk_1:  I just I listen so I know everything everything
spk_0:  but if they're younger students or just um
spk_1:  There's a mix of the high school kids like 1920 year old and there's some married women in there an older women
spk_0:  and
spk_1:  younger kids a couple
spk_0:  of black people and that sounds about you know it's like a good mix but
spk_1:  it seems like this kid who
spk_1:  saying oh I'm not being prejudiced black and he's like always question the teachers and stuff And he thinks like well your father you know that's it's control that you brought up in the house and do what he says And that's that's okay to learn that and stuff And that's okay do with your kids and she's trying to teach him that's not okay to do that someone self respect and do things like that Like a couple of people like to argue with her and like really ignorant and stupid
spk_0:  Well I guess the teacher she wanted something Yeah So
spk_1:  um but it's
spk_0:  it's good
spk_1:  I mean it's been interesting They had a hypnotist come in the other day but I didn't wanna do it just because I was I was skeptical of it and not really um enthusiastic about
spk_0:  it Yeah
spk_1:  I didn't feel comfortable
spk_1:  like I was I was more interested in watching people around me
spk_0:  Like
spk_1:  if they really kind of like really got into it And
spk_0:  I don't know if I would ever do it I'd be real curious to see whether I could be hypnotized I would be afraid or
