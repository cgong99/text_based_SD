spk_1:  didn't realize that there was a there was a I mean because I've always had trouble with my landlord so I've never I mean I've always been sort of aware that whenever I've left that there's that anxiety and you probably when you left first of all you didn't know you were gonna stay there you know it's like it's all sort of like ends up so
spk_1:  I can understand that I
spk_0:  can I can

spk_0:  choice Yeah the cut and everything and I mean I don't know if it's worth it I mean I'm like okay maybe then I'll never be able to go back you know but that's
spk_1:  not true

spk_0:  oh you know this power of thought thing but otherwise I'm you know I'm okay I just I think I need some sort of
spk_0:  change or something I need to change either board you know with what I'm doing not with what I'm doing art but with my life that I need some sort of
spk_0:  I need to have some you know physical change or visual change because you know I need to have just been working and

spk_1:  It's it's
spk_0:  weird It's
spk_1:  it's definitely like
spk_0:  first of
spk_1:  all
spk_0:  um
spk_0:  like I came I've been out
spk_1:  Here for about six weeks now It's taking me a
spk_0:  while to
spk_1:  settle in It's definitely like
spk_0:  oh man it's
spk_1:  horrible It's so
spk_0:  disgusting reports there I'm like I know and I wake up in the morning
spk_1:  and it's
spk_0:  overcast and the sun doesn't shine The thing is in New York
spk_1:  City
spk_0:  it might be hot but at least
spk_1:  like the sun
spk_0:  is shining or you'll get those big those big
spk_1:  city breeze is like
spk_0:  you know what I mean
spk_0:  You know what I mean Yes I do you get the air doesn't even move like you're so lucky
spk_1:  and
spk_0:  then it moves like there'll be a thunderstorm in the afternoon and everybody runs out to try to get the air and it's like and then it's
spk_1:  gone and then it's like it's the
spk_0:  the
spk_1:  depression is there Exactly and it's like all the steam rising off the ground
spk_0:  but um
spk_1:  okay so I don't like the weather and I think that I feel like I'm in the suburbs because I don't have a car and I feel like I need a car to get around to places that I need to get to because things those sort of scattered around that they're like it's like being like at Macdowell but without the but without the um you know the fact that like somebody goes on a daily basis into town or you know those kind of things It's it's definitely like
spk_0:  Uh get a really cheap one
spk_0:  Well I'm a bunch of uh Yeah Yeah
spk_1:  I'm thinking about getting a junk mobile I was thinking about I wanted to get like a like a real like something that I could have for a couple of years or something like that
spk_0:  And I've been looking around I don't really see it Excuse me
spk_1:  I've gotten into this bad habit of remember when I was an
spk_0:  undergrad and I used to
spk_1:  watch Star trek
spk_0:  Really I'm watching Star
spk_1:  trek reruns at midnight
spk_0:  because there's a great
spk_1:  guy that that that I've gotten to be friends with a couple of people that I've got to be friends with actually they watch Star trek at midnight
spk_0:  Like the next generation though
spk_1:  Uh Star trek that it is Well it's one with Captain Picard
spk_0:  mm
spk_1:  I don't know which one that is
spk_0:  that's the yeah that's the earlier one I like the new one next generation It's
spk_1:  cool
spk_0:  anyway I can do
spk_1:  it you're so bad anyway so that's why
spk_0:  Um
spk_1:  but um
spk_1:  anyway uh what was I gonna say Um
spk_1:  so it
spk_0:  took me a
spk_1:  while to settle in because and and I'm still not totally settled in I've started to do some some work
spk_0:  I
spk_1:  did the first month that I was here I took a class in digital music um which is like electronic you know like music editing and stuff like
spk_0:  that
spk_1:  because I've been you know working with sound and I'm interested in working more with sound and stuff And so that was really good There was a concert at the end of it and I felt
spk_0:  pretty
spk_1:  good about my contribution to that Like it wasn't really exactly what I would love but I felt
spk_0:  great Yeah so that was that was good that was
spk_1:  something that you know like being here gave me access to I'm also learning a lot about computers like um like about other things about computers like about um
spk_1:  you know how to do email and how to do like
spk_0:  interesting
spk_1:  networking Yeah Yeah I mean if you get if you get a laptop and you should also try to get a modem and hook it up to a phone because then you can have well I mean like I have a lapse I have uh an email address I don't know who else that you know has an email address but it's the kind of thing that I would like
spk_0:  I'm trying to contact with people Yeah
spk_1:  I'm trying to like tell people because it only costs like a local phone call Like if you
spk_1:  if you call New York I mean if you wanted to write somebody in New York you could like you could
spk_0:  type it a fax Yeah it's but it's better It's
spk_1:  even cheaper than the fact I think because it's
spk_0:  it goes into the computer it's not like a paper
spk_1:  paper but it's it's cheaper because it's the cost of a local phone call where it's
spk_1:  take the amount of time you
spk_0:  know That's really great And then you can get access to all any any information you really need I mean if you needed something about research or
spk_1:  whatever right
spk_0:  Yeah it's amazing
spk_1:  Yeah So yeah like the internet and all that kind of stuff so that's that's like I'm learning about that so that's kind of cool And um and then uh
spk_1:  and I'm
spk_0:  supposed to start
spk_1:  teaching in September I'm a little bit nervous about that because I have to still put together like a course Syllabus
spk_0:  John get over two weeks away
spk_0:  I know
spk_0:  I know I know you can talk about emails like that now I'm talking
spk_1:  with you but that's okay
spk_0:  I'm
spk_1:  just joking
spk_0:  but okay you know what Hold on one second You know what I have
spk_1:  to go to the
spk_0:  bathroom Hold on a second the phone say
spk_1:  what I
spk_0:  can bring the
spk_1:  phone into the bathroom It doesn't stretch Hold on
spk_0:  Hi hi thanks for this call the University of Pennsylvania
spk_0:  Um um So anyway so um
spk_1:  well yeah
spk_0:  it's
spk_1:  like I
spk_0:  I am
spk_1:  a little I
spk_0:  mean the thing is I've never taught
spk_1:  a class
spk_1:  Well that's not true I thought
spk_0:  the same
spk_1:  class in Germany but it was different
spk_0:  Uh what is it upstate new york that
spk_1:  Was teaching I was teaching three D Design which is really different because that was freshman These are like graduate students
spk_0:  really well that's that's intense How many how often do you see that I teach
spk_1:  twice twice a week we meet for three hours
spk_0:  And um so
spk_1:  anyway so
spk_0:  that's
spk_1:  going on So
spk_0:  um
spk_0:  but I mean it's good It's weird like I've been having you know
spk_1:  the thing about your saying like about you know like giving up the apartment in New York and those kinds of things I mean I've been thinking about those kinds of things again also because you know I think to myself like you know I can make life easier for myself I could come to Berlin I could probably like you know make you know you know get the paperwork in order and make
spk_0:  it very
spk_1:  easily
