Speaker 0    00:00:00    So anyway, how are you doing these days?  
Speaker 1    00:00:02    Things are going very well. I think I had mentioned before that, um, that, uh, that, uh, that there's a company now that I'm working with, um, uh, which is very much just, just myself and Chris and that, um, no, you hadn't mentioned that. Oh, okay. Okay. So, um,  
Speaker 0    00:00:18    And you told me that you were leaving the company that you were at and you were entertaining offers and, uh,  
Speaker 1    00:00:24    Well, well, it seemed to make sense since I had a client to, to just kind of set up my own company of sorts. So, um, some things are going extremely well. So I had one client who said that he'd pay me a minimum amount, you know, he'd, he, uh, there'd be a minimum amount of work of about a, a day a week for the next two, three years, which is sufficient to pay all my bills. And so I decided that it would make sense to do this. And, um, and, um, I've been getting substantially more work on that. So I'm quite pleased, quite pleased.  
Speaker 0    00:00:55    Well, that's  
Speaker 1    00:00:56    Good. So, um, so I have a bunch of, uh, work that I need to do on my flat this year. I've been telling you that I needed to do that roof atrium for quite some time, but it should, uh, it should come out this year. Oh, well, that's good. It should be done in a few months.  
Speaker 0    00:01:11    Oh yeah. I remember you talking a little bit about it at one point. Yeah.  
Speaker 1    00:01:16    Yep. So you have no intentions of coming over this way anytime soon.  
Speaker 0    00:01:21    Um, I don't see the finances occurring no, for a while. Um, actually right at the moment, finances are not going real well, but oh wow. I'm working on that one. Uh, it's just, uh, the, the main reason for that is I had not really anticipated a few expenses that recently came up, uh, related to a couple of burglaries that I had.  
Speaker 1    00:01:46    Oh,  
Speaker 0    00:01:46    Harsh. Harsh. Yeah. Yeah. But yeah, not a whole lot. I can do about that now. Indeed, indeed. To deal with the situation. And so that's what I'm doing, but, um, anyway, uh, one of the main reasons that I've been such a pathetic, uh, correspondence has been work, I've actually been doing a lot of it.  
Speaker 1    00:02:10    Oh  
Speaker 0    00:02:11    Wow. And, uh, I turned in my master's thesis back in may and I'm actually presently working on, um, several, um, articles.  
Speaker 1    00:02:22    Oh, okay. Impressive.  
Speaker 0    00:02:24    Yeah. Actually it turns out that one thing one little bit in what I was doing, uh, is going to turn out to be very important in the end. And, uh, from what I had been reading in the literature, see the one very annoying thing about all of this was my advisor's been in France for a year and a half. Yeah. And this made writing my thesis very annoying because you know, there wasn't much discussion. Yeah. Yep. Yep. But, um, anyway, I had been kind of telling him that, you know, from my, my reading of the literature, I thought that this one little alteration I had made in my model was kind of clever and unique mm-hmm <affirmative> and it made one type of solution occur, which was seen experimentally, but none of the other models had, uh, had yes. BA basically I I'm looking at, um, multi-mode lasers. And one of the things that they find experimentally are what they call anti phased, uh, states, where if you look at the total intensity Uhhuh of the laser, you get an oscillation, which is characterized by one frequency.  
Speaker 1    00:03:43    Yes. Okay.  
Speaker 0    00:03:44    If you look, I, if you separate out the different modes of the laser mm-hmm <affirmative> and look at one of those, you get more than one frequency. Okay. So what's happening is that the modes are oscillating out of phase so that they completely mask each other's  
Speaker 1    00:04:01    Exactly  
Speaker 0    00:04:01    Oscillations on these other frequencies. And, uh, you can, with a pretty simple model, you can find that frequency in a transient, but you can't find that frequency in a driven, uh, frequency you can't find so that it will sustain.  
Speaker 1    00:04:22    Okay.  
Speaker 0    00:04:22    Yes. So, you know, that, that particular frequency, according to most models, DS out very quickly. And so you shouldn't actually really be able to ever see it. Hmm. The only thing is that when you do the experiment, you see it.  
Speaker 1    00:04:37    Got it. Got  
Speaker 0    00:04:38    It. I see. So, um, I found a simple modification of the original formula, which unfortunately makes the solutions horrendously nasty and in most cases, uh, insoluble, but it gives a driving term <laugh> oh, okay. So it actually creates a situation where you get the right sort of answer. You just can't always write it down very easily.  
Speaker 1    00:05:06    Exactly. Oh, wow. So, so, so, so you you're pushing forward the bounds of theoretical laser, laser, uh, whatever it is, science,  
Speaker 0    00:05:15    Which, um, is kind of interesting considering that that's not really my thing  
Speaker 1    00:05:21    <laugh> indeed, indeed.  
Speaker 0    00:05:23    Be being an experimentalist, not a theorist, but, um, indeed.  
Speaker 1    00:05:27    Oh, wow. Oh, impressive. So, so, so, so are you gonna get an article in nature or something?  
Speaker 0    00:05:32    Um, actually, I'm not sure if we're shooting for op I think optics letters is probably the one that we're shooting for or else perhaps though. I don't think it's quite that significant would be FIS rev letters. Hmm. But, uh, we want to write a letter and then a couple articles.  
Speaker 1    00:05:59    Yeah.  
Speaker 0    00:06:00    Hmm. I don't know how much, you know, about scientific literature, but letters are much more prestigious than articles.  
Speaker 1    00:06:09    Oh, okay. Oh, I didn't realize then. Okay.  
Speaker 0    00:06:11    Yeah. So that's, that's why it's actually a big deal. Is I, you know, writing a couple articles based on your master's thesis is not at all unusual in physics. Yeah. And, uh, it's the fact that I would be writing a letter that is the impressive part of it all. And what's actually kind of interesting is I kept telling Neil that I thought that this was kind of significant and Neil kept writing back that I should tone this part of the thesis down that people have been seeing the, you know, people see the anti phased motion and it's true. They do in the transient. And I was having a lot of trouble getting across to him that all of the literature is in, has this frequency in the transient. Yeah. And not driven. And, uh, what happened was after I had turned in my thesis, but before I saw Neil, again, he went to a conference in Rochester and there, this was a big issue among the people who were doing this work was that their models couldn't show this as a driven frequency yet their experiment showed it a driven frequency.  
Speaker 1    00:07:22    Oh  
Speaker 0    00:07:23    Cool. And so Neil then like a week later came to BN Mar and he said, Hey, Lowell, we gotta write this up.  
Speaker 1    00:07:30    Exactly.  
Speaker 0    00:07:31    I was like, well, I've been telling you that deal indeed. So  
Speaker 1    00:07:36    Cool. That's  
Speaker 0    00:07:37    Cool. That's mostly the sort of stuff that I'm spending a lot of time on now. Um, well,  
Speaker 1    00:07:42    It'll look good on your CV, your resume. So, so you might as well spend the time.  
Speaker 0    00:07:48    Yes. Well, uh, no, it's definitely worth doing. Um, and I would have been spending more time on it if it weren't for, uh, dealing with the burglary issues. No. Yeah. That I've been dealing with. So  
Speaker 1    00:08:00    Are you still living in that house? In the middle of  
Speaker 0    00:08:02    The park? Yes.  
Speaker 1    00:08:03    Yeah. Okay. Yeah.  
Speaker 0    00:08:05    I, the thing is that it, this place is incredibly easy to break into if you want to, it's not a question of whether or not, uh, you know, that that was easy. It was just that no one really knew it was worth breaking into.  
Speaker 1    00:08:20    Exactly. Exactly.  
Speaker 0    00:08:21    Yeah. And so the problem is that now they've found out that it's worth breaking into. Yeah. And unfortunately, well, it's kind of odd. They've stolen very weird things for the most part as far, you know, it's like the first time they broke in, they, what they stole was just bizarre, mostly worthless stuff. And uh huh. The most worthwhile thing, as far as monetary value went that they stole was the pre amplifier of my stereo. Unfortunately, because it's a nice pre amplifier. It has an offboard power supply, which they didn't steal, which makes the thing that they stole absolutely worthless. Huh.  
Speaker 0    00:09:10    So these are, these are so, so, so when they broke in the second time, did they steal the, uh, the, uh, offboard Amplifi actually no, all they stole the second time was my bike. Huh. Which was actually where the major problem came. Exactly. Exactly. Yeah. I suddenly had no transportation and so I then had to go bike hunting and eventually get another bike. And that, that cost me a lot of time. Yeah, exactly. Spending a lot of time hunting for bikes and oh wow. And getting one purchased and then having to, you know, go get it and things like that. But that's dealt with at least. And so, uh, that's you at least dealt with now? I just have to work on the financial aspects of all of this, but yeah. Yeah. At least during the summer I can actually, uh, according to the stipulations of my grant or my fellowship, I can actually earn money during the summer.
