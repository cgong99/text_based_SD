A:  So anyway how are you doing these days
B:  Things are going very well theres a company now that Im working with um uh which is very much just just myself and Guss
A:  oh
B:  And that um
A:  No you hadnt mentioned that
B:  eh oh okay okay so um
A:  eh you told me that you were leaving the company that you were at And uh
B:  Well i well it seemed to make sense since I had a client to to So um
A:  oh
B:  So things are going extremely well about uh a day a week for the next two three years
A:  mhm
B:  Which is sufficient to pay all my bills then so I decided that it And um and um Ive been getting substantially more work than then
A:  mm
B:  So Im quite pleased quite pleased
A:  Well thats good
B:  So um so I have a bunch of uh work that I need to do on my flat But it should uh it should come out this year
A:  oh well thats good
B:  It should be done in a few months
A:  oh yeah I remember
B:  So
A:  you talking a little bit about it at one point
B:  yeah yeah So you have no intentions of coming over this way any time soon
A:  um I dont see the finances occurring
B:  uhhuh right
A:  for a while um actually right at the moment finances are not going real well But
B:  ah well
A:  I am working on that one uh Its just
B:  But um
A:  uh uh the the the main reason for that is I had not really anticipated a few expenses that recently came up
B:  ah
A:  uh related to a couple of burglaries that I had
B:  oh harsh Harsh
A:  yeah yeah but and Not a whole lot I can do about that now
B:  Indeed Indeed
A:  have to deal with the situation And So thats what Im doing
B:  Sounds good
A:  But um Anyway uh One of the main reasons that Ive been such a pathetic uh correspondent has been work Ive actually been doing alotof it
B:  oh wow
A:  And uh I turned in my Masters thesis back in May and Im actually presently working on um several uh articles
B:  oh okay Impressive xxx
A:  from it yeah actually it turns out that one thing one little bit in what I was doing uh is going to turn out to be very important in the end And uh from what I had been reading in the literature advisor has been in France for a year and a half
B:  yeah
A:  And this made writing my thesis very annoying because you know there wasnt much discussion
B:  yeah yup yup
A:  But um Anyway I had been kind of telling him that you know from my reading of the my model was kind of clever and unique
B:  mhm
A:  And it f made w the one type of solution occur which was seen experimentally but none of the other models had uh had
B:  Yes
A:  They basically the I Im looking at um multi mode lasers And one of the things that they find experimentally are what they call anti phased uh states where if you look at the total intensity
B:  uhhuh
A:  of the laser you get an oscillation which is characterized by one frequency
B:  Yes okay
A:  If you look i if you separate out the different modes of the laser
B:  mhm
A:  and look at one of those you get more than one frequency
B:  okay
A:  So whats happening is that the modes are oscillating out of phase so that they completely mask each others
B:  Exactly hm
A:  oscillations on these other frequencies And uh you can With a pretty simple model you can find that frequency in a transient but you cant find that frequency in a driven uh frequency You cant find so that it will sustain
B:  okay Yes
A:  So yeah that that particular frequency according to most models damps out very quickly And so you shouldnt actually really be able to ever see it
B:  hm
A:  The only thing is that when you do the experiment you see it
B:  Got it got it I see
A:  So um I found a simple modification of the original formula which unfortunately makes the solutions horrendously nasty And in most cases uh insoluble But
B:  yeah
A:  it gives a driving term
B:  oh okay
A:  So it actually creates a situation where you get the right sort of answer you just cant always write it down very easily
B:  Exactly oh wow theoretical laser laser uh whatever it is science
A:  But which um is kind of interesting considering that thats not really my thing
B:  Indeed
A:  Be being an experimentalist not a theorist But um
B:  Indeed oh impressive
A:  But
B:  So so so are so are you going to get an article in Nature or something
A:  um actually Im not sure if were shooting for op I think Optics Letters is probably the one that were shooting for or else perhaps though I dont think its quite that significant would be Phys Rev Letters
B:  hm
A:  But uh we want to write a letter and then a couple articles
B:  yeah xxx impressive
A:  And I I dont know how much you know about scientific literature but letters are much more prestigious than articles
B:  oh okay okay
A:  yeah so that thats why its actually a big deal is I mean you know writing a couple of articles based on your Masters thesis is not at all unusual in Physics and
B:  yeah
A:  uh i its the fact that I would be writing a letter that is the impressive part of it all And whats actually kind of interesting is I kept telling Neil that I thought that this was kind of significant And Neil kept writing back that I should tone this part of the thesis down that people have been seeing th in the transients And I was having alotof trouble getting across to him that all of the literature is in has this frequency in the transients
B:  Yes
A:  eh and not driven And uh what happened was after I had turned in my thesis but before I saw Neil again he went to a conference in Rochester and there this was a big issue among the people who were doing this work was that their models couldnt show this as a driven frequency yet their experiments showed it as a driven frequency
B:  oh cool
A:  And s and so Neil then
B:  Said oh just a second I
A:  like a week later came to Bryn Mawr and he said hey Lowell we got to write this up
B:  Exactly
A:  And I was like well Ive been telling you that Neil
B:  Indeed
A:  So
B:  Cool
A:  Thats
B:  Cool
A:  thats mostly the sort of stuff that Im spending alotof time on um
B:  Well itll look good on your C V your resume So so you might as well spend the time
A:  Yes well uh th no its definitely worth doing um and I would have been spending more time on it if it werent for uh dealing with the burglary issues
B:  oh yeah but
A:  that Ive been dealing with
B:  So are you still living in that house in the middle of the park
A:  Yes
B:  yeah okay yeah
A:  I mean the thing that i this place is incredibly easy to break into if you want to
B:  oh
A:  Its not a question of whether or not uh you know that that was easy it was just that no one really knew it was worth breaking into
B:  Exactly yeah
A:  And so the problem is that now they found out that its worth breaking into
B:  yeah
A:  And unfortunately Theyve stolen very weird things for the most part
B:  hm
A:  A as far yeah as a The first time they broke in they what they stole was just bizarre mostly worthless stuff And uh
B:  huh
A:  the most worthwhile thing as far as monetary value went that they stole was the preamplifier of my stereo Unfortunately because its a nice preamplifier it has an off board power supply which they didnt steal which makes the thing that they stoled absolutely worthless
B:  huh
A:  So
B:  Thats bizarre Bizarre So so so when they broke in the second time did they steal the uh the uh off board amplifier
A:  Actually no all they stole the second time was my bike
B:  huh
A:  Which was actually where the major problem came
B:  Exactly yeah
A:  Is that I suddenly had no transportation And so I then had to go bike hunting and eventually get another bike and
B:  mm
A:  that that cost me alotof time
B:  yeah Exactly
A:  Because yes Spending alotof time hunting for bikes and
B:  nah well
A:  then getting one purchased and then having to you know go get it and things like that But thats dealt with at least And so uh thats yeah at least dealt with But
B:  yeah
A:  yeah At least
B:  Well that would make sense
A:  during the summer I can actually uh according to the stipulations of my grant or my fellowship I can actually earn money during the summer
