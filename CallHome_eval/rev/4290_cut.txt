Speaker 0    00:00:00    And I said, well, you know, that's far away from home, any familiar faces of comfort, even if it is just Mike prices.  
Speaker 1    00:00:06    Yeah. Yeah.  
Speaker 0    00:00:10    Hmm. Anyway, um, well it was fun. The food was great. It was catered. It was just wonderful. Wow. And I won't tell you everything cause it's all in your letter.  
Speaker 1    00:00:18    Okay. Yeah. I, that every time I get a letter, I said, well, we've covered all this. And uh, but it's so good to get the letters. Yeah.  
Speaker 0    00:00:27    You can reread them,  
Speaker 1    00:00:28    Reread them. Yeah. And I have  
Speaker 0    00:00:30    Reread them  
Speaker 1    00:00:31    Murray and get my pictures. Yeah. Oh yeah. See, they can't say ours over here. And some of these hotels, a lot of the hotels and you get in the elevator and you wanna go downstairs. You have to press for Robbie,  
Speaker 0    00:00:41    Robbie,  
Speaker 1    00:00:42    Robbie, Robbie  
Speaker 0    00:00:43    Mm-hmm <affirmative> it's spelled R O B B Y.  
Speaker 1    00:00:45    Yep. <laugh>  
Speaker 0    00:00:50    Well, when I called the first time to get your room number and, uh, I, I said, um, he said, who do you wanna talk to? I said, um, McGuire, he said, what's the name? I said McGuire. And he said, Mr. Very <laugh>. I said, yep.  
Speaker 1    00:01:04    Rat him. Yeah. Well, they have a problem with that. So it's deep.  
Speaker 0    00:01:11    Yep. Um, let's see. I'm just going to work and back and forth. So I'm filling out applications for jobs and trying to get them sent in. I've gotta finish 'em up Monday. Yeah.  
Speaker 1    00:01:21    Well, you had, you've had an interview at, at valley already.  
Speaker 0    00:01:24    Yeah. Um, it, it was fine. They'll call me if they have any night classes available, but right now they don't. So mm-hmm <affirmative> and they don't, they're probably not gonna get any, so I just have to wait and see Northridge. I don't know anything about either, but it's all in the letter. That's in the letter. Mm-hmm <affirmative> um, let's see, I'd talked to Ken and Vicky yesterday. Can I? And I think Ken might have gone to Arizona today to work. He got laid off when they stopped. Um, well, you weren't here when they had the big sinkhole in Hollywood. No. Due to the Metro whale.  
Speaker 1    00:01:51    Well, they had those off and on, well, not big one. Well,  
Speaker 0    00:01:54    There was this one that was about, you know, five blocks long. It was, oh, really? Well, not five blocks, but it was, you know, a good,  
Speaker 1    00:02:00    Good sized haul.  
Speaker 0    00:02:01    It was, it cause Boulevard for a long time. It was about, um, 60 feet by a hundred feet or something. Wow. It's big. And so they shut down Metro rail because you know, it's all because of that. They're not doing things the way they're supposed to. And consequently, the Boulevard's caving in and Ken was working that, you know, so, um, he, he was laid off and um, he just, they said the other night that he thought he would go to Japan cause he could get the Japan go to Arizona because he could, um, you know, sign up and start working Monday. Only the pay is not as good as here. So he has to work overtime and it's a 60 hour week. And therefore he can't come home on weekends. So yeah.  
Speaker 1    00:02:41    Wow.  
Speaker 0    00:02:42    I think he, I, he was doing the yard this morning. I said, well, maybe he's not going if he's in the yard work. And then later I saw him packing up the truck and then I missed when he left. I didn't see, you know, Vicky say goodbye or anything. So he may be off to, to Arizona for God knows how long we have new neighbors. They moved in.  
Speaker 1    00:03:01    Well, who are they? What are  
Speaker 0    00:03:03    They? There's some kind of Mexicans with three kids.  
Speaker 1    00:03:06    Oh boy.  
Speaker 0    00:03:07    And a dog.  
Speaker 1    00:03:09    Oh boy,  
Speaker 0    00:03:09    The dog seems fairly cool that he hasn't bark too much.  
Speaker 1    00:03:12    Is he a big,  
Speaker 0    00:03:13    Dog's fairly big. He looks sort of like a Bob size, but pish, but doesn't weigh as much as Bob. Hmm. And Jojo had one of his parties again. Last night, boy, they're out there till all hours. Oh they do that. I know. That's fine. I thought I looked over. I said here, I wonder if he's got the new people over there already, you know, <laugh>  
Speaker 1    00:03:34    Is, uh, Joey's still doing the lawn. Yep. I told you, I sent you some money. And then I told you, it's also paying cuz I think he's going on vacation. He  
Speaker 0    00:03:43    Went on vacation the second week and I, I took after he, the second week after he'd done the grass, two times I went over to uh, you know, give him 20 bucks because I thought I knew he was going on vacation and it was Dennis was there and I said, well, I know Joey's going on vacation. So I wanted to give him some money. So he'd have it. And Dennis said, he is already gone. And Vivian said, Dennis rode the lawn today. And I said, well, you make sure Joey gets his money. <laugh> anyway, he's been doing a good job. He forgot one day and came over later that night. And he was just apologizing all over the place. And I said, it's no big deal, Joey. Just do it tomorrow. <laugh> you know? Yeah. So I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I just feel terrible. I said, don't worry about it. It's no problem. I told him yesterday you might hire him full time. Cause you don't like to do the grass.  
Speaker 1    00:04:25    Well, I, I might, depending on how long this money holds out <laugh>  
Speaker 0    00:04:30    Well, if we're gonna have to buy a new card here, you know that.  
Speaker 1    00:04:32    Yeah.  
Speaker 0    00:04:32    I know that my transmission's going.  
Speaker 1    00:04:34    You're kidding.  
Speaker 0    00:04:35    I'm sure it is.  
Speaker 1    00:04:37    Hmm.  
Speaker 0    00:04:39    It's having trouble in reverse.  
Speaker 1    00:04:41    Wow.  
Speaker 0    00:04:41    So I'm keeping an eye on it, but we just have to do it. That's what we'll do when you first get home, we'll buy the new car.  
Speaker 1    00:04:49    Yeah. They may have to do that right away.  
Speaker 0    00:04:53    We really do. We shouldn't try to get any more miles outta any of these cuz they're gonna get stuck with  
Speaker 1    00:04:57    Oh no, I don't. I don't really want to, I just, uh, want to get out there in that first week and start doing it. You.
