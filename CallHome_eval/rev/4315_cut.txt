Speaker 0    00:00:00    I'm doing good. I'm going to Susan's back and forth and my sister's back and forth. Yeah. Susan's away this week. So I I'm going to my sister's tomorrow. She needs a babysitter on Thursday.  
Speaker 1    00:00:09    Yeah. So I'm  
Speaker 0    00:00:10    Going tomorrow, but I feel  
Speaker 1    00:00:11    Like I thought she was going away for vacation this week. She's away now. Oh, she's away now.  
Speaker 0    00:00:15    She's coming back  
Speaker 1    00:00:15    Tonight. Yeah. Yeah.  
Speaker 0    00:00:16    So, um, I feel like this always happens when I get towards the end and I have this list of things to get, you know, like George has a little list and I have to bring for him, his wife and his kids. I have to bring first.  
Speaker 1    00:00:27    Oh, for, to bring back. She gives you the list. I wouldn't bring her back  
Speaker 0    00:00:32    Anything. Oh my gosh. She said, did I tell you about this episode before I left?  
Speaker 1    00:00:34    Yeah. You told me, oh, she such  
Speaker 0    00:00:36    A shit. Well, I just can't, you know, you have to pretend. Sometimes I bought just cute little like, uh, makeup type of case. You know, if you have to go away for a little makeup and sanitary pad. And then I said to myself, oh my God, maybe she doesn't have a period anymore. She's like almost 50.  
Speaker 1    00:00:48    This will be a funny conversation to  
Speaker 0    00:00:50    Listen to. And a little perfume side of it. I can't go and give everyone's stuff in, not heart. You know, I am not gonna break off my relationship with him because of her.  
Speaker 1    00:00:57    So you said doing shopping around  
Speaker 0    00:00:59    It, I still have to. I'm gonna ask you good. I didn't get them yet. And I've gotta get stuff at the Wiz whisper miash for George  
Speaker 1    00:01:07    At the Wiz. Yeah.  
Speaker 0    00:01:08    He wants some stuff for the video camera. Oh. He gave me such a list and including sneakers, him and her, I can't bring the sneakers back. Cause I'm going, I don't wanna take an extra suitcase with me. I gotta pay $90 for an extra  
Speaker 1    00:01:19    Suitcase. Yeah. And  
Speaker 0    00:01:20    George said, no, I once went back and I bought two extras and they just let me go. Why can't take that chance. They might not let me, what am I gonna  
Speaker 1    00:01:26    Do? The baby, uh, is not allowed a suitcase,  
Speaker 0    00:01:29    Right? No, nothing. Not even a carryon. So, um,  
Speaker 1    00:01:32    What'd you come with one suitcase? No,  
Speaker 0    00:01:34    I was an idiot. I came with two.  
Speaker 1    00:01:36    Yeah,  
Speaker 0    00:01:36    But I came with a regular one and a regular one inside of a big one. So when I'm gonna do is I'm gonna leave the small ones here and take my mother's big one. So I have two big  
Speaker 1    00:01:45    Ones. That's a good idea. Cause  
Speaker 0    00:01:47    They really see I'm doing on Michelle. I'm getting smart. Yeah. Help Michelle. Very, you know, practical. Um,  
Speaker 1    00:01:53    The other thing is instead of taking one of your mothers, if she doesn't, you know, you wanna relinquish it or whatever, she doesn't care. She'll get at that. You buy, you go to the supermarket and you get a pampered cotton. Right. And you just load it up and then you just throw the curtain away. Yeah.  
Speaker 0    00:02:07    That's true. No, she doesn't care. I'm leaving her mind and she's giving me this one. Doesn't I, it doesn't matter for  
Speaker 1    00:02:13    Me. Yeah. I told Sheira two. I says, if you need things, why aren't you start shopping around? Don't wait till the last  
Speaker 0    00:02:18    Minute. Oh my God. No, she can't. And she's got kids and I'm going with the baby all the time. You gotta take,  
Speaker 1    00:02:23    She, she left today. She said she was going out of her mind. You know, look just for stuff. Well, your  
Speaker 0    00:02:27    Mother wasn't  
Speaker 1    00:02:28    With her. My mother had like a luncheon today and she was meeting a friend. Did  
Speaker 0    00:02:32    She went with the three  
Speaker 1    00:02:32    Kids? No, no. Daniel was in a little day camp. So she took Tamar and the baby,  
Speaker 0    00:02:36    They put 'em  
Speaker 1    00:02:37    In a day camp. Yeah. They're both going to a little camp. I mean, they're bored every day to going to the beach, you know? Sure.  
Speaker 0    00:02:43    That's fun.  
Speaker 1    00:02:44    So tomorrow goes,  
Speaker 0    00:02:45    No, it's really hard. Like Susan was taking me and she's with her kids. You just gotta know what you're going for and do it fast. And I get crazy. Cause I said, oh, look at, and I start looking and I wanna try on and, and, and you know, I start seeing things and my father's good. You know, he's taking me. We went to cross county shopping center in the morning.  
Speaker 1    00:03:02    Um, well don't, they have ads there in the Sunday paper, stuff  
Speaker 0    00:03:05    Like that. Yeah. Childs. You're not even gonna believe what I bought in. I don't. Do you have Woolworths  
Speaker 1    00:03:09    Woolworths? There's not too many left around here.  
Speaker 0    00:03:12    We have two in, in a, in a, in, in, uh, we have a few around and I always wanted this, a Jean jacket, you know, a real rugged, you know, regular guy's Jean jacket. Yeah. And it's really pretty expensive. I saw here they're like 60, 80 we're in Woolworth's and they have these beautiful Jean jackets for $20. So I bought one. It's pretty funny getting clothes on Woolworths. Cause they're like, you know, five and dime stores. Yeah. No cheap, but it's, it's, it's beautiful. It's maybe Italy. It's really nice. Good. And uh, I wanna go back there with my father. Cause I had nice books and cardboard books like cheap two for five, you know, mark down stuff. English books.  
Speaker 1    00:03:46    Oh sure.  
Speaker 0    00:03:47    Um, cause this kid's learning English so quickly. Did, did  
Speaker 1    00:03:51    Your brother, uh, bring, uh, give you the money or he's gonna pay  
Speaker 0    00:03:56    You back when he goes said, no, he said, let mommy said, she'll lay it out and I'll give it back to her. When she calm. My mother's like, yeah, write my foot.  
Speaker 1    00:04:03    Oh geez. And  
Speaker 0    00:04:03    My father's like you, you need tot give you money. He didn't give you money. He almost 60 years old, you're still buying her mother. Didn't wanna say no. She said that he's gonna like pay back some of the stuff.  
Speaker 1    00:04:12    When is your mother gonna come visit?  
Speaker 0    00:04:13    If she wants to come in October.  
Speaker 1    00:04:15    Yeah.  
Speaker 0    00:04:15    But if my father doesn't wanna come or if he has weddings, he's not gonna leave. He gets like a wedding or two. He won't go. Yeah. And then my mother will not wanna leave him. But just the same reason why she didn't wanna go to Virginia, she don't want, she wouldn't leave him for a month or three weeks.  
Speaker 1    00:04:29    But is he feeling okay? Yeah,  
Speaker 0    00:04:31    He's feeling okay. Had a little episode before Virginia, you know, but um, it's okay. It might not even have been from that. He felt dizziness and maybe cause with the heat,  
Speaker 1    00:04:39    Maybe the, he just so goddamn hot. He  
Speaker 0    00:04:42    Felt a little funny. He felt a little funny in the chest, but that could be your reaction goes to the heat today was really it. It's very humid. You know? It's hot. I mean, tab is very hot too, but it's dry and this is humid. I don't know. What's worth.  
Speaker 1    00:04:54    I think the humidity it's very uncomfortable.  
Speaker 0    00:04:56    It's  
Speaker 1    00:04:56    Not humid and ti be area in the  
Speaker 0    00:04:57    Summer. It's dry. No. It's like Tel Avida Adivas  
Speaker 1    00:04:59    Image. Yeah, there  
Speaker 0    00:05:01    Was another, yes. I  
Speaker 1    00:05:02    Can't believe  
Speaker 0    00:05:02    It. I'm just gonna say terrible. I just heard it yesterday. My Ash was in Tel Aviv with the kids.  
Speaker 1    00:05:07    He was for the day.  
Speaker 0    00:05:08    But my mother called yes, like two days, my mother called, um, um,  
Speaker 1    00:05:15    Your mother-in-law. He  
Speaker 0    00:05:16    Called, he called my mother no yesterday, but it, he called after this happened and I wasn't here. My mother sister said, what, what did he say? Maybe I should call. And she said, well, he called after this. And um, and he didn't say anything. He just called today. Also.  
Speaker 1    00:05:29    Where was he? Was? He was,  
Speaker 0    00:05:33    He was with us. Yeah. He was sleeping at <inaudible> but he was going, he went to super land. It's a big, big amusement park there and whatever, just going around. I got pierced ears. She, she told me,  
Speaker 1    00:05:46    Oh my God kept  
Speaker 0    00:05:48    Kidding me. I, I called from Susan's because, um, cause it's cheap for Friday night. Right. So Susan's got Friday night. So I, I called ATT asked how much would D and I gave her the money right there cuz you  
Speaker 1    00:05:58    Know? Yeah.  
Speaker 0    00:05:59    Can't ask her. So, um, just go for five or six minutes. It was $10 something. It was like the medium price. Yeah. Wasn't the cheapest. It was the medium. Yeah. So, um, cuz I knew where they would be. Then I knew if I call any other time, like I might get, then I might not. But I know they're at his mother's at nine o'clock on Friday night. So God was so excited. They sounds so good. Gal was all excited until she can get out of her mouth. She said I got my Pierce earrings, so I'm gonna get them each pair of earrings. Talia wants to, she just wasn't around when I did it to  
Speaker 1    00:06:27    Her was Talia had her ears P too.  
Speaker 0    00:06:29    No I'm saying she wants to, she wasn't with him when he went, got a

Speaker 1    00:06:50    Well, when you get back, you have  
Speaker 0    00:06:51    To like, I have to just continue, but it's hard. You start getting into this, you know, into this thing again. It's not like she and rich. I wish it was, you know, to English  
Speaker 1    00:07:00    Speaking. Yeah. But you know what Manash is speaking so much better now I can't get over him.  
Speaker 0    00:07:04    When did you hear him?  
Speaker 1    00:07:05    When we came married really? You know my parents said, oh he speaks English. I says, yeah, he speaks English. I says he doesn't really speak English, but I could see that he didn't have been  
Speaker 0    00:07:15    Studying. Oh he wants, oh, he wants me. He keeps spending. I'm gonna take a course in English cuz you're not teaching me. Have they teach him  
Speaker 1    00:07:22    Well, speak to him  
Speaker 0    00:07:23    In English? That's the thing. But it's easier said than done. When you talk to someone that you're leaving with, you know, you wanna get things done, you know, quickly and on the spot, you  
Speaker 1    00:07:31    Know? That's true. You know what I mean?  
Speaker 0    00:07:32    Yeah. It's easy. It's very easy to say, but you can't imagine until, but  
Speaker 1    00:07:37    Oh I know people are yell at me. Why cloudier doesn't speak to me in Spanish. Right.  
Speaker 0    00:07:41    You know? So, so I really have kids and you'll  
Speaker 1    00:07:44    Speak to them in Spanish.  
Speaker 0    00:07:45    Yeah. So what's happening in that department? When's the next thing?  
Speaker 1    00:07:47    Well, I gotta go Friday. Did  
Speaker 0    00:07:49    You, your  
Speaker 1    00:07:50    Kids, did  
Speaker 0    00:07:51    You cry?  
Speaker 1    00:07:52    No.  
Speaker 0    00:07:52    No good.  
Speaker 1    00:07:53    No, because I, you know, it was late. It was 32 days. But um, I thought maybe there'd be some slight miracle that  
Speaker 0    00:08:04    I'm telling you. I just two girls that I work with went through these things and they have kids now,  
Speaker 1    00:08:08    You know? So I'm shooting up every night and Friday, Friday for the Al ultrasound and your tushy? Well in the morning and at night I give myself a shot at  
Speaker 0    00:08:17    My stomach, my God.  
Speaker 1    00:08:18    Oh my God. And then at night cloud, it gives me what does this do for the eggs? Um, well the shot that I take morning and night holds off the ovulation. Yeah. And the shot at night promotes eggs, egg, you know, follicle, growth,  
Speaker 0    00:08:33    Whatever. So you guys add ultrasound to what? To see what? To  
Speaker 1    00:08:36    See, how they're progressing. If there's eggs there, if they're big  
Speaker 0    00:08:39    Enough. Wait a second. This is being recorded. Michelle.  
Speaker 1    00:08:42    I don't care. They don't know me. Okay.  
Speaker 0    00:08:44    Do I  
Speaker 1    00:08:45    Know you do. I know you?  
Speaker 0    00:08:47    What else?  
Speaker 1    00:08:48    I'll tell him a joke yet. This little boy says to his mother, to his father. Daddy, how does mommy get pregnant? How does she have a baby? Well, the mommy makes the eggs and the daddy makes the sperm and we put 'em together and the mommy grows a, a baby in her belly. Yeah. So the little boy says to his father, well, how does the sperm get into her belly? Does, do you put it in through her mouth? So the father says only when she wants jewelry, jewelry. You don't get it. Um, maybe I'm not sure. Oh, be shit. What? Only when she wants jewelry, like she'll give a blow job only if you know she wants something. Oh, okay. Okay. Oh, be you need, I guess I have to have some more experience. Oh my. Oh no, you have too much. Okay. Okay. No, because they call those, the family jewels. Know if that had something to do with it? No, no. I knew blow job. I understood blow job. Okay. When she wants something when she wants a diamond ring or something. Yeah. Right, right. Okay. Okay. What else? How much more time do we have? How much more time? Yeah, I know. They'll come on and give us a little, oh, someone when you call I'm so thrilled. Yeah. I'm so honored. Meanwhile, I called you just sitting down to dinner. Your mother will show.
