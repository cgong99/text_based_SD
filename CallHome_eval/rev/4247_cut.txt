Speaker 0    00:00:00    Great. What should we talk about <laugh>?  
Speaker 1    00:00:03    Well, I don't know. Tell me what's going on in America. I haven't seen the news in ages. Really?  
Speaker 0    00:00:08    You  
Speaker 1    00:00:08    Didn't in America news, but I know what's going on in Russia, but  
Speaker 0    00:00:11    Yeah. Well, let's see. What's going on. Uh, you want me to just give you some headlines?  
Speaker 1    00:00:18    Yeah. Gimme some headline what's plaintiff up to,  
Speaker 0    00:00:21    Yeah, I was just gonna say, Clinton just came out yesterday with his, uh, his statement concerning affirmative action  
Speaker 1    00:00:27    Uhhuh  
Speaker 0    00:00:28    <affirmative> and, and basically he has in the past said that he was not in favor of, um, you know, of making, um, allowance is strictly based on race, but at the same time, uh, the analysis in the news, shall we say the conservative analysis in the news is that Clinton just came out and said that he doesn't believe in quota systems and in reverse discrimination, but that he does believe that affirmative action is necessary to move, uh, you know, black Americans forward and to give them the opportunities that they've been denied. So he is trying, he's kind of walking a tight rope, you know what I'm saying? Right. In other words, trying to  
Speaker 1    00:01:11    Please  
Speaker 0    00:01:11    Everybody. Yeah. Let's see if we can make everybody happy. I think that he's  
Speaker 1    00:01:17    And he just ends up making nobody happy.  
Speaker 0    00:01:18    I think you're right. <laugh> cause you know, affirmative actions really under attack in the United States from many different quarters. Right. And it's a big, it's a big issue because it's supposed to be a gender. I mean, not a gender, a race, uh, colorblind, we're supposed to be race colorblind. And yet it's like contractors that are bidding, you know, with the high bid or higher than the lowest bid are still getting the contracts only because they are of ethnic, protected, you know, black or whatever. And it's really, you know, and then, and so they're taking lawsuits to the Supreme court and all this. So it's wow. Another thing that just came up was that the Supreme court said that the, um, redistricting of the congressional districts, one of which is in Georgia violated the constitution because it was based primarily on race. There was, you know, they  
Speaker 1    00:02:15    Did, they were doing it because they were trying to make it for like, they were trying to make it less segregated.  
Speaker 0    00:02:22    They were trying to make the district majority black Americans. So therefore they drew it, uh, all the way across the state. You see what I'm saying? Oh, right. A, a very narrow district. And it created a majority black district, which then elected a, a black representative and then it was challenged because it said, well, the only reason this has been done this way is just to ensure that it was majority black and that's not, you know, hello,  
Speaker 1    00:02:56    I'm  
Speaker 0    00:02:56    Here. Okay. Anyway,  
Speaker 1    00:02:58    I'm modeling all this over.  
Speaker 0    00:02:59    Yeah. I mean, it's, it's,  
Speaker 1    00:03:00    It's interesting. Cause today we had a discussion with students about, um, cuz we are doing a pre departure orientation. So we were, we had a hot topic discussion today where we break in small groups. So we talked about like political correctness or racial prejudice and sexual for harassment, feminism, and just like different topics that they might encounter in America where the, of different attitudes here most. So that was one of the things that kind of pushed up. But I was not really up on what the attitude is in America, cuz I haven't been there in so long.  
Speaker 0    00:03:27    Well, there's a lot of frustration. I think over the fact that there, there are a number of evidences that the affirmative action program is in fact discriminating in the other direction. And people are saying, wait a minute, why don't we just give everybody, uh, a, an try to give everybody an equal shot? And if someone feels that they've been discriminated against because of their race go at it from the standpoint of, of trying to remedy it through the courts, rather than saying that government has to give X number of contracts to minority, no matter what.  
Speaker 1    00:03:58    Right.  
Speaker 0    00:03:59    And as a result, some, uh, some people are getting contracts just because of the color of their skin. And you know what I'm saying? It's, it's  
Speaker 1    00:04:08    When they might not even be the most qualified  
Speaker 0    00:04:10    E either then they're, they're not even, they're not the low bid, you know, normally on contracts you take the low bid that meets the quality spec specifications.  
Speaker 1    00:04:19    Right.  
Speaker 0    00:04:19    And, but now you've, there have been several cases where clearly, you know, it was, they didn't get it because they just didn't, weren't the right colored skin. So now is that, is that really Remming the situation or is it just creating a lot of, uh, of, uh, resentment and it's kind of too bad? I  
Speaker 1    00:04:37    A  
Speaker 0    00:04:37    Mess. Oh, it's a mess. It really is. How long have you been there? By the way?  
Speaker 1    00:04:42    Over here? Um, it'll be three years in November.  
Speaker 0    00:04:45    Wow. So you really are out of touch aren't you <laugh>  
Speaker 1    00:04:50    I'd like to think I'm not ally outta time.  
Speaker 0    00:04:52    Well, I know what it's like. I  
Speaker 1    00:04:53    Was never very in touch even when I was still in America, so  
Speaker 0    00:04:56    <laugh> oh, okay. You're that type. I gotcha. <laugh>  
Speaker 1    00:04:59    I was always doing in my own world anyway, so,  
Speaker 0    00:05:03    Well, I know what it's like, because I having lived over in Korea for almost three years. Um it's you know, when you come back, all of a sudden the, you know, the society's changed a little bit, you know,  
Speaker 1    00:05:13    Uhhuh  
Speaker 0    00:05:14    <affirmative>, new terminology, new buzz words and all of that stuff. Right. Of course, when you get to be over 40, like me, um, you could miss that stuff. Just being an American anyway.  
Speaker 1    00:05:28    <laugh> <laugh>  
Speaker 0    00:05:29    It all passes.  
Speaker 1    00:05:30    I don't know. I always think when you get older, you're more informed when I was in college. I didn't know what was going on. I was too busy.  
Speaker 0    00:05:35    Yeah. I'm thinking of, uh, you know, like, uh, lingo that the young people come up with, you know, young guru people. Yeah. I think I'm more informed now than I was in college. I was sort of out of it in college, but uh, by the way, did I tell you that I have a new job?  
Speaker 1    00:05:54    Well, in your email, you said that you're gonna start your new Justin, but you didn't say what your new job was.  
Speaker 0    00:05:59    Oh, okay. Um, I resigned here last week, effective artist 10th, and I'll be taking the job of the director of English language, um, the English language program of a private university, uh, in Atlanta, a larger university  
Speaker 1    00:06:15    Uhhuh.  
Speaker 0    00:06:16    So it's kind of a step up for me. It's it's called Mercer university.  
Speaker 1    00:06:20    Oh, you'll have to send this material somewhere.  
Speaker 0    00:06:23    Hey, now we're talking. You can glad you send people into ESL programs.  
Speaker 1    00:06:29    Well, we get requests about it. I don't know how many people actually go. Cause a lot of them, you know, don't have a lot of money, but we get students every year that ask about her that say they have money. Well, you can be, don't come though in talent, whether or not they go.  
Speaker 0    00:06:41    Yeah. Well you can be sure that we will send you information because, um, you know, I've got to go down there and we're trying to, to improve the program. We're adding, they're adding thousands of dollars of, uh, state of the art language, you know, equipment, uh, lab equipment and all of that. And they're restructuring everything. So that's what I'm supposed to do next.  
Speaker 1    00:07:02    Do they have any scholarships, performance students?  
Speaker 0    00:07:05    I I'm. I've never heard of a scholarship for an English language program personally, but I think never  
Speaker 1    00:07:11    Did either, but I keep thinking I'm gonna find one one of these  
Speaker 0    00:07:13    Days. Yeah. I know. I'm sure that they prob you know, the question of whether they have scholarships for international students, um, for the regular program is a good one. And I'd like to find out, I'd like to think that they do. And, and I think they might, but I don't know yet. Right. It's not gonna be my particular area of expertise. You know, it's, it's, that's, that's gonna be regular program, but still, I would like to know. So I tell people like,  
Speaker 1    00:07:40    So were you looking for a new job or did they just like come to you?  
Speaker 0    00:07:43    Well, I was looking for a new job and I've been looking for about a year and a half. Oh. And, uh, when I went to NASA in new Orleans, you know, the one that you missed <laugh>  
Speaker 1    00:07:55    I know the one degree when there was so much fun.  
Speaker 0    00:07:57    Oh, it was a blast, but I'm not sure it was more fun than Miami. I mean, you know, <laugh>, it was fun though. You would've enjoyed it. And as I said to you in the email, the, uh, the Russians and the Siberians and all of these people were just hilarious. I mean, we had a, we had a nice little visit. We really did, um, too bad. I didn't, I  
Speaker 1    00:08:16    Can't believe they were calling her. Love you. We were in stitches to hear that she was calling herself lovey  
Speaker 0    00:08:21    <laugh>. Oh, really? You didn't know that.  
Speaker 1    00:08:23    Well, cause you wouldn't say that cousin Russian it's just, you know, do both, but it's just a Russian name. I mean, you wouldn't think of ING, anything English, but the thought of people calling her lovey in America is so fun.  
Speaker 0    00:08:33    Well, that's the, that's what she said. I mean, I didn't know.  
Speaker 1    00:08:36    Well, it's so hard. Like it's just so hard to do that, that I just, I just think it's  
Speaker 0    00:08:41    Hysterical. Yeah. You should have seen them dancing around with the crowd out there when they had this, uh, Caribbean band or something that run the streets of new Orleans. It was kind of interesting, but, um, yeah, and we went, we went on a shrimp boat tour also. It was kind of fun. Um, you know, you gotta sort of do that kind of weird stuff. Um, I interviewed for this job at the, at NAA, so that's kind of how it got to where it was. Uh, you know, that was a major, major state, uh, major point to reach is do that interview. And that was a good interview. So yeah, I kind of, I knew they were trying to expand the program and I said, well, if you're gonna do that, call me, cuz I would be interested in an opportunity. And so I've taken it, you know?  
Speaker 0    00:09:30    Great. Yeah. I'm excited about it. So what city were, what city were you in? Were you far from Atlanta? No, actually, uh, Brunelle is located north of Atlanta, about 50 miles north, uh, up the freeway, which around here is, you know, not even considered to be that far <laugh> Uhhuh, but, but this, and I don't even live in Gainesville, which is a city where this universe, where now is I commute about 33 miles from the Southwest. It's a 45 minute ride and I'll be commuting. So you'll be closer now. Well actually I maybe two or three miles closer, I'm be commuting down into Atlanta. See, I live north of Atlanta.
