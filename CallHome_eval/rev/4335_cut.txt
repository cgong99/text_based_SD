Speaker 1    00:01:02    Oh, daddy said, um, something bad. I said we can go to soons. He said, no, no, we don't wanna go anywhere. We just wanna sit around and talk. Oh <laugh>. And I said, you have to see her Sue. It's really cool. It's got the jungle and the penguins  
Speaker 0    00:01:13    And the short Mary  
Speaker 1    00:01:14    Said, okay,  
Speaker 0    00:01:16    You  
Speaker 1    00:01:16    Sit around and talk. She's ready to go. <laugh>  
Speaker 0    00:01:19    Well, I mean, I, I wanna do some of that, but, you  
Speaker 1    00:01:21    Know yeah. And I just decided that, you know, I to wear em, you know, and I said, you have to go to Mr. CS, the plastic grapes and bites and well,  
Speaker 0    00:01:28    Yeah, we have to go there. Well, even at the beach, you know, who's the one who always wants to go to AWI. That's right. Yeah. Cause I think he  
Speaker 1    00:01:36    Feels like he needs entertain entertainer down there, but Danny's a goer. He's the door where he gets tired  
Speaker 0    00:01:41    Of just, he gets tired, but he likes to go, do I figure he loves that Nelson art gallery. Yeah. So I figured we'll go down and I haven't been there for quite a while and they all, they change it a lot. Yeah.  
Speaker 1    00:01:49    You know, they change exhibits and stuff.  
Speaker 0    00:01:51    Right. So I thought we'd go down there and have lunch in that, um, atrium type deal they have there. And  
Speaker 1    00:01:56    I think the thing is he doesn't wanna go like for a whole day necessarily. But if he just goes someplace part of the day, I think that breaks it up. Right. Kind of. Yeah.  
Speaker 0    00:02:05    Yeah. That's kind of what I figured we'd do. And then I have a  
Speaker 1    00:02:08    Letter from mum yesterday.  
Speaker 0    00:02:09    Oh, what did she say? That's  
Speaker 1    00:02:10    Kind of interesting stuff.  
Speaker 0    00:02:12    Oh really?  
Speaker 1    00:02:13    Just a little bit. Yeah. She told you that or not about how they had an offer on her house and stuff.  
Speaker 0    00:02:17    Yeah. She did tell me they had an offer. Cause I called her to talk to her about the talk to  
Speaker 1    00:02:21    The plane ticket. Yeah.  
Speaker 0    00:02:23    And um, I said, well, what are they asking for the house? And she didn't know, she just needed, the offer was $30,000  
Speaker 1    00:02:29    Below. But Todd told me they were asking two  
Speaker 0    00:02:31    60. Oh  
Speaker 1    00:02:32    Really? Yeah. Hmm. And he, or 2 59, 9. I can't remember what he said. We said they had it like at two 60 and then agent said they should put it like 2 50, 9, 9 or something. Yeah. So that, because some people, and I did, you know, and I thought they should probably put it like two, be below two 50 would be a normal cutoff place for a lot more  
Speaker 0    00:02:54    People. Oh yeah. You know,  
Speaker 1    00:02:55    And  
Speaker 0    00:02:56    Well, but the thing about that, some people look a little higher than that and then offer two 50. Right. Yeah. You know? Um, but it's so noisy. I hate it. When the girls do that, when I'm on the phone, what is it? The ice maker. Oh, and I mean, it just sounds like an earthquake. You can't hear a thing when that's on, um, what did they pay for the house? What did they pay to? What  
Speaker 1    00:03:17    2 25 or something. And then they put in the pool.  
Speaker 0    00:03:20    Yeah.  
Speaker 1    00:03:21    And she said, she said it was 20 below their bottom line. So apparently they're willing to go down 10 mm-hmm <affirmative>. But to me, just south of fricking thing, I mean, get rid of that. I mean, they had an offer. They should jump on  
Speaker 0    00:03:33    At me. I mean, well, I mean, when you look at what happened to make on his house and they can take that loss on their taxes.  
Speaker 1    00:03:39    Yeah.  
Speaker 0    00:03:40    You know, I mean, you can recoup a little bit,  
Speaker 1    00:03:41    Would even be a loss. I don't know what the pool costs, but it'd probably be about, well, two 30, that would be  
Speaker 0    00:03:47    Loss. Yeah. They would take a loss on it. But you, like I said, you can write that off too on your taxes. And um, cause  
Speaker 1    00:03:54    This is the one you'd think would be wanting to get rid of it.  
Speaker 0    00:03:56    Cuz she's paying  
Speaker 1    00:03:57    For nurses basically. At least Todd gets to live there.  
Speaker 0    00:04:00    So I know. Yeah. Well I know when, um, Mitch sold his stock to get the money and build their house, he had to sell it a loss and we've taken that loss on the tax return. I think next year's the last year we get to take it. And he said, that really hurt us when we go get to take that anymore. Yeah. And I forget you can take so X number of dollars, rent  
Speaker 1    00:04:20    It out over. Yeah.  
Speaker 0    00:04:21    Yeah. You can stretch it out and that'll be gone. But you know, that's kind of a nice, especially if he's going to be a single person.  
Speaker 1    00:04:27    Yeah. And she said that he said neither one I'm in  
Speaker 0    00:04:30    File or  
Speaker 1    00:04:31    Divorce. And then that wasn't an issue. The main thing was selling the house first and then they could get the rest of it in order. How weird something about that. Julie has really butched out. I guess she's got her hair cut.  
Speaker 0    00:04:42    Oh really  
Speaker 1    00:04:43    Short as than me, you know, shorter than a lot of mens, you know? And, and my she's so funny when she write something about, she thought Susan was the man in the relationship. And then she said, I don't know much about this. Can both have them be men,  
Speaker 0    00:04:58    Which is kinda funny. Geez. Well Susan definitely wants to be a man.  
Speaker 1    00:05:04    Yeah. So, but then Southern gal gotta hair Butch that short  
Speaker 0    00:05:07    Then God. Yeah. It sounds like she wants to be a man too. Mm-hmm <affirmative>  
Speaker 1    00:05:10    Geez. So like mother says, who knows maybe they can both  
Speaker 0    00:05:13    Be men, I guess. So that is just so bizarre. Yeah. It really, but like I said, I think the red flags where they're all long and we chose to ignore them. Yeah. Because we wanted happiness for Todd. Oh  
Speaker 1    00:05:24    Yeah. Oh yeah. That was my very first thought. And they thought, oh, don't be so mean. Don't even say that, you know?  
Speaker 0    00:05:29    Yeah. Yeah. I,  
Speaker 1    00:05:30    I looked out that window and they were in the backyard and it took me a minute to decide  
Speaker 0    00:05:33    Which one was Todd.  
Speaker 1    00:05:35    Yeah. And I was like, Hmm.  
Speaker 0    00:05:36    Yeah. Well I'll never forget that night when they were right before the wedding. When she said, when she mentioned that girlfriend mm-hmm <affirmative> and how, you know, she thought, um, this girlfriend at works that they couldn't be friends anymore. And she told her that was silly. And I thought, why is she tell me about a  
Speaker 1    00:05:50    Girlfriend? Yeah, yeah. I  
Speaker 0    00:05:52    Remember  
Speaker 1    00:05:52    Then, you know, I mean, yeah.  
Speaker 0    00:05:53    All the little bells went off in my head, but I just thought, no, no,  
Speaker 1    00:05:56    No, no. You know, <laugh> I know there's a lady in our office who was married and got divorced and her last kid just graduated from high school and she was talking about that she was gonna sell her house and get a small place and she wanted to be out in the country and blah, blah, blah. And yeah. And, um, I'd seen her year or so go at a restaurant with a lady and you know, and they acted guilty when you saw them, you know, was one of those things. Yeah. I mean, it was the Saturday night, you know, but, but it was kind of like she, and it was a small restaurant yeah. That I, other people picked it, but it was like way out the way and not a place I've ever been before ever heard of and right. And there she was. And so she kind of, it was, it was just a little different than it, you know?  
Speaker 1    00:06:34    And I thought that's kinda strange. And then I thought they, they kind of looked like they were, you know, yeah. Pretty close and stuff. And so anyway, then my secretary told me, the other day said, oh, Miranda was in today. Did you know? She bought a house. I said, well, we was talk this spring. And she said something she was going to and stuff. And she said, well, she bought it with another lady. She said, oh. And I told her about seeing her in the restaurant and how they acted kind of weird and stuff. And she said, well, I've always kind of wondered about her. Cause she was a real man hater. She just, oh really? I just figured that was cuz she went through a bad divorce and he really did. He ran around and he had another woman and it was kind of a bad deal for her.  
Speaker 1    00:07:07    So, but anyways, you know, it just all makes sense. You, like I said, the little signals were kind there, but you just said, oh, that's, you know, yeah. Don't jump to conclusions. You know its, cuz the lady out with another woman, you know, mm-hmm, <affirmative>, that doesn't mean she's a lesbian or anything. And then I really thought even if they lived together, I suppose they don't necessarily have to have a sexual relationship. No they're and I've thought of doing that before. And I, I still think if something happened to Ted, you know, later on and they had a woman friend that I enjoyed and stuff I wouldn't, you know, I'd be opposed to place together or something to share your expenses and have the companion and stuff. And it wouldn't mean we were sleeping together, but I each to their own, yes, that's really, it's just too bad.  
Speaker 1    00:07:47    Taught had to be caught in something. Yeah. And I said, get messed up with all that. So yeah. I guess he's still going to church every Sunday. Mother said he stopped by on his way to church or something. And so I don't know. Maybe we can find somebody else in church, another church, you know, I think that would be better, you know? Oh yeah. And, and then quit going over to see her parents and stuff. I think that's just kind of prolonging me too. It is. But think, I think you need that. You do it until you don't need it. Right. You have to let go gradually I think. Yeah. Yeah. And when, when, somehow when that's not right for him anymore, so yeah. Poor and little brother, but mm-hmm <affirmative> this seems to be doing fine. Really think so. Yeah. But its just kinda interesting. And then she wrote some stuff about Mary Braman too. <laugh> oh really? I hang on. I gotta get this way. It's just right over here. Okay. This is free. It'll just take a second. Yeah.  
Speaker 1    00:08:49    Thought I had everything here ready for my call, but I had my and my banana and everything. Um, I don't see her. I forgot this letter. What she say? She said, um, I went out to see Mary last week. They'd moved her from the therapy department to a regular room. And her rooming is a black woman. Mary was out at the nurse's station waiting for bill and Leslie Anne to pick her up and take her home. They told me she's been doing this for a couple of days. She did know me and kept asking where I thought she should wait. Then she asked me to take her home and I told her I couldn't. Then she wanted me to call them and see when they were coming. Finally, I tried to explain they weren't coming and she asked who isn't coming <laugh> so my heart heavy. I told her I had to go and laughed. I had tried to get her to go back to her room, but she kept asking why I said that was her room. So sad. I surely hope I never end up in that state. If I do don't ever come see me and break your heart. <laugh> better to remember me as I was not in that condition. So trying to see if she said anything else about Todd.  
Speaker 1    00:09:54    Um, oh yeah. She said he was going up to Baltimore for a week. So she was yeah, she was cat sitting. Yeah. She told me that. Yeah. So they have an offer house 3000.
