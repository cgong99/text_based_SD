Speaker 0    00:00:01    Paul.  
Speaker 1    00:00:01    Hello? Yeah,  
Speaker 2    00:00:02    <laugh>  
Speaker 0    00:00:03    Weird. Okay. Uh, <laugh>  
Speaker 1    00:00:07    It's not a really good connection. It's to a satellite or something, cuz there's a, a delay.  
Speaker 0    00:00:11    Is there? It, it sounds okay here for me.  
Speaker 1    00:00:15    Oh, I hear a delay. Oh, but maybe that's the recording.  
Speaker 0    00:00:21    Yeah. I don't know. Well, it could be a delay if it is bouncing off satellite. Better do it.  
Speaker 1    00:00:27    Yeah. <laugh> anyway, uh, you guys are coming to Europe.  
Speaker 0    00:00:30    Yeah. Um, bunch of second here. I, I sent you the date. I don't remember right off hand  
Speaker 1    00:00:39    The 19th. There is that.  
Speaker 0    00:00:43    Yeah. So it's about right. We're we're actually leaving next Monday and we should be arriving in London, joy. Um, <laugh> great. Um, I made this file that had all the information in it and now my computer doesn't wanna open it.  
Speaker 1    00:01:16    Oh,  
Speaker 0    00:01:18    Modern. What is it? Wonders and modern technology or something like that.  
Speaker 1    00:01:25    So you start school. When, when do you start, uh, with your, your you're doing a PhD or a master's first or?  
Speaker 0    00:01:32    Um, well, I'll be doing a, I'm gonna go for the, the master's first and then hopefully transfer to a different school to get my PhD, um, going to OSU for the master's. So I'd like to go to like Cornell or Michigan or Wisconsin or UB for my, my PhD  
Speaker 1    00:01:54    Someplace with a reputation.  
Speaker 0    00:01:55    Yeah, exactly.  
Speaker 1    00:02:00    So is the file opening or not?  
Speaker 0    00:02:01    Um, no, it's not what actually, let me, let me do something else. I can just look at all the email I sent you and that one's probably whatever I said was correct. If I said the 19th, then that's probably what we were shooting for.  
Speaker 1    00:02:21    What, what are you doing?  
Speaker 0    00:02:23    What's  
Speaker 1    00:02:24    That? How's this trip gonna work?  
Speaker 0    00:02:26    How, uh, we're gonna fly into London and then yeah, we'll be there for about two or three days and then go off to Ireland and then we'll come back to London and then catch a ferry over to O Austin Day. And then from there, just come up to Holland. So probably not, we're not gonna stay in Belgium at all. We're just going straight up to Holland, so,  
Speaker 1    00:02:49    Okay. Yeah.  
Speaker 0    00:02:52    I'm sorry. Go ahead.  
Speaker 1    00:02:54    No, it's okay. If I say anything, I can't hear you anymore. So a strange kind of, uh, phone call. It's like talking on a radio where you have to say over because you know, anyway,  
Speaker 0    00:03:06    I can hear everything you say, even when I'm talking. I think,  
Speaker 1    00:03:11    Yeah, maybe it doesn't inter maybe it doesn't interface well with the Dutch system then I don't know.  
Speaker 2    00:03:16    <laugh>  
Speaker 0    00:03:18    Over.  
Speaker 1    00:03:19    Yeah. Over  
Speaker 0    00:03:20    <laugh>. So it looks like we'll be coming in on about the 19th,  
Speaker 1    00:03:28    So, okay.  
Speaker 0    00:03:29    Where, whereabouts are you? You said you're not where away from Amsterdam.  
Speaker 1    00:03:36    Yeah. Um, the problem is we don't have a place to put you up. Oh,  
Speaker 0    00:03:42    That's that's no big deal.  
Speaker 1    00:03:44    Yeah. But right. If it, yeah, it kind of we're, we're kind of in transition. I'm living right now with Ana's parents. Mm-hmm <affirmative> but we have a, we have a flat, um, that we just, that we just got and we take possession of on this actually, you know, officially we're renting it on the 16th, but onion, our parents have been fixing it up and uh, that's just outside of UTRA.  
Speaker 0    00:04:07    Okay.  
Speaker 1    00:04:09    Do, do you know, like, have you looked at a map, do you know where these places are?  
Speaker 0    00:04:12    Yeah, I that's kind of like Southeast of, of Amsterdam, correct?  
Speaker 1    00:04:17    Yeah. Yeah. If you draw, if you look at like Rotterdam is directly south of Amsterdam mm-hmm <affirmative> and then, and, and Rotterdam on the Rotterdam's on the coast with the, of the north sea Amsterdam is you go inland a little bit and north and it's on the it's on the coast of, uh, what they call the ISEL Mar it's an inland C and then UTRA is, is a triangle and it's sort of a nice softly triangle.  
Speaker 0    00:04:48    So it's about even about as far as, as Rotterdam  
Speaker 1    00:04:53    As yeah. It's, it's like equal distances about an hour from Rotterdam. It's about an hour from Amsterdam. I actually a little closer to Amsterdam. It's about 45 minutes to Amster, to Amster down. And uh, but yeah. What, what are your plans? Are you going to be going into Amsterdam and staying somewhere? Or what, what are you gonna do?  
Speaker 0    00:05:11    Yeah, we'll probably just go into Amsterdam and stay unless, you know, the better place to stay or something that you would think would be better.  
Speaker 1    00:05:19    No, I, I mean, if you're, if you're looking for a place to stay, Amsterdam's probably the best place to go. Um,  
Speaker 0    00:05:26    Can do the more, sorry,  
Speaker 1    00:05:29    Go ahead.  
Speaker 0    00:05:30    We'll probably be there about two days and then, and then we'll head off to Paris.  
Speaker 1    00:05:36    Oh, okay.  
Speaker 0    00:05:37    So we planned on being there for a little while to see you.  
Speaker 1    00:05:41    Yeah. What is, I don't even know what day the 19th is and I don't have a calendar with me.  
Speaker 0    00:05:45    Um,  
Speaker 2    00:05:49    Let's  
Speaker 0    00:05:49    See. Hold on just a sec. Cam,  
Speaker 2    00:05:57    Can  
Speaker 0    00:05:57    You come here for a sec, please? It's a Wednesday.  
Speaker 1    00:06:07    Is it a Wednesday? Okay.  
Speaker 0    00:06:08    Do you have a map of Europe in that sheet that I printed up with our trip plan? Luckily I printed it out. It's I got this new version of Excel, Excel five and, um, on the Mac, the creation kind of conflicts with something else I think. And so the computer thinks it's launching some other program and it causes all kinds of things to happen. Thanks. Yeah. Okay. Okay. I see. Yeah, I was, I was kind of going off by memory and yeah, this, this looks pretty much like what I thought it was. Um, we are planning on coming in. Let's see, we're leaving Ireland, Dublin on the Monday, which is the 17th, and we're gonna try and catch like an all night type thing where you hop on a bus and then arrive in London the very next, you know, the next morning.  
Speaker 1    00:07:06    Right.  
Speaker 0    00:07:07    And, um, then we'll just try and catch. So we, we arrive Tuesday in London Tuesday morning. We won't try and catch a train to the coast and then catch a ferry over to, um, over to Oden day and then come up into Amsterdam or Rotterdam, but either way, um, who  
Speaker 1    00:07:34    Is yeah,  
Speaker 0    00:07:35    Rotterdam is, is Belgium. Isn't it? No,  
Speaker 1    00:07:38    No, no, no, no. Rotterdam is, is Holland.  
Speaker 0    00:07:41    Okay. Although looking at the ferry here, we might go up up the coast from LA and then catch a ferry from wick to, to Rotterdam.  
Speaker 1    00:07:52    Yeah. You, what you, what you wanna do is Harwich to hook on Holland. That's what, that's how the ferry are. I've taken that ferry from London, Uhhuh, and, uh, you can get, you can buy one ticket and it's the train. It it's actually, it covers the train expense from London all the way to hook fund Holland. Is  
Speaker 0    00:08:13    That very expensive?  
Speaker 1    00:08:14    Um, I can't remember how much I paid, but it's not outrageous.  
Speaker 0    00:08:18    Okay.  
Speaker 1    00:08:18    Like, like I, maybe it was a hundred or $150  
Speaker 0    00:08:22    Really?  
Speaker 1    00:08:23    Yeah. But it wasn't, I mean, yeah, something like that. It might have been 70. I, I, I, I can't remember  
Speaker 0    00:08:29    Did it for a hundred bucks. It might as well just take the channel or 150 bucks. We can catch that all the way to, to Brussels. And then we've got a UIL pass that we could take up into, up into Holland.  
Speaker 1    00:08:43    Oh, then. Yeah. Well you might wanna check because of the Euro pass, you might be able to get a discount on the, on the ferry too.  
Speaker 0    00:08:50    Yeah, we won't get it on the train. England's the only country over there that doesn't participate.  
Speaker 1    00:08:56    <laugh> they have, they have their own pass. They have a Brit rail pass. Oh,  
Speaker 0    00:08:59    Of course.  
Speaker 1    00:09:00    Yeah. They, they don't consider themselves European. They're British. <laugh> they're not European. There's Europe and there's Britain. And if you talk, if you like, if you listen, they're they always make that distinction. They'll always say, if you ask a Bri, where is Europe? He won't point like down where he's standing. He'll point across the channel to like those other people <laugh>. But I have to work. I'm working that whole week. Okay. I just started with this new job Uhhuh, but I can meet you in the evenings, um, on, you will not be here as you, you know, as you said, you know, if you hadn't met her before, there's a good chance. She didn't really exist. Yeah.  
Speaker 0    00:09:39    <laugh> and uh, and I spoke to her today, yesterday.  
Speaker 1    00:09:42    Yeah. Well, you've heard a voice. You still, you still, if you'd never seen her that yeah. I could be ed, my sister. Yeah. But uh, I hired  
Speaker 0    00:09:49    Her didn't you?  
Speaker 1    00:09:50    Yeah.  
Speaker 0    00:09:52    Did, did you get that email yesterday?  
Speaker 1    00:09:55    Yes, I did. Okay. Got it. Today.  
Speaker 0    00:09:57    Just, I was just trying to, I, I didn't call on you back just because I knew I'd have to call you back again. And, um, I don't know how much the phone call was, but I imagine it's not cheap. <laugh>  
Speaker 1    00:10:08    <laugh> but yeah, that, that's fine. So, uh, you'll be coming in the 19th. Um, and you're leaving, been  
Speaker 0    00:10:15    Looking at this, if we can, we might be coming in the evening of the 18th, but you know, who knows? Maybe we were kind of planning a whole day to get from Ireland to, to Holland, but maybe it's only gonna take us a half a day. And in which case, maybe if we come in early enough, we can give you a call and then we'll leave for, for parents the day earlier or something.  
Speaker 1    00:10:37    Yeah. We have a phone number at our new place, but we don't know it yet. <laugh> so yeah, I mean it, this, the Dutch phone, system's a little, little slow. So, uh, what we're gonna do is, uh,  
Speaker 0    00:10:49    If you get it,  
Speaker 1    00:10:50    I will,  
Speaker 0    00:10:52    If you get it, I was gonna, you can just email it to me cuz I I've got my computer set up over here and I can check email and stuff.  
Speaker 1    00:11:00    Okay. That's what I was gonna say is hopefully Ana's gonna call tomorrow and find out why our phone works. We didn't really expect it to work so soon. And uh, if it's working because they've hooked it up and we have a number, then she's gonna get the number. But um, if they say, well, it's hooked up. Cause we didn't, we didn't disconnect it from the last people. And it'll take us six months to get you a phone. Then we will, you know, we'll just have to wait. But um, if we do have a phone number, oh, I don't know how long it takes. I'm just mocking, mocking the Dutch system. And I's not here to make, to tell me to shut up. So,  
Speaker 0    00:11:34    So you can get away with it.  
Speaker 1    00:11:35    Good deal. Yeah. But no, uh, will, uh, uh, you can always reach me at my in-law's house because for the most part I come back here. Um, yeah, at least every other day I will come back here at least every, every other day in J in, uh, July being as most of my clothes are here. And uh, <laugh>  
Speaker 0    00:11:58    Where, where do they live?  
Speaker 1    00:12:00    Inre a town called Bria. If you look at Rotterdam and then you go Southwest.  
Speaker 0    00:12:05    Oh, okay. I see that.  
Speaker 1    00:12:07    And uh, yeah, it's a real, it's a small little town and it's real nice and uh, has lots of history to it and where we live, we live in a town called kin. That's just south of, of UTRA.  
Speaker 0    00:12:21    Okay.  
Speaker 1    00:12:22    If I don't know if that, that may not be on the map. I don't know. No,  
Speaker 0    00:12:26    It it's a very, um, well, let's, let's see, it covers the entire continent of Europe and part of Asia. So  
Speaker 1    00:12:34    Yeah. Kin is actually bigger than, uh, than B. So I thought B's on there. Maybe new, new kind is too, but kin  
Speaker 0    00:12:42    It could be your pronunciation. I see a, B R E D a. Is that it?  
Speaker 1    00:12:46    No go. You have to go we're by UTRA UT, R E no. Th HT see that?  
Speaker 0    00:12:52    Yes.  
Speaker 1    00:12:54    Okay. If you go just south of that real, very close. There's a canal just south of the, of the, uh, of UTRA where it is. And then there should be a town on that called Newhan new, new. It would be Newhan  
Speaker 0    00:13:07    Uh, no, that's not on there.  
Speaker 1    00:13:09    No. Okay. Well, we live right. If you look at UTRA we live right there and uh, and I have an auto, so that's not a problem. Um, yeah. So if you guys are going to be, I'll have to figure out with, with, uh, Ana's parents, um, you know, what, what I'll do, maybe I'll, I'll stay over here that night. Um, and then I'll just come meet you guys, but you guys are, you guys are gonna come into how you can. Yeah. Let me give you my work number. Uh, if I can find my work number  
Speaker 0    00:13:43    And do they speak German there because if they do, I can,  
Speaker 1    00:13:47    They will at my work. Yeah. They'll speak English. Oh, okay. If you, if you call work they'll they will speak, um, English to you. Okay. If you speak English to them, they'll speak English back.  
Speaker 0    00:13:57    <laugh> okay. Cause I, I talked to your father-in-law and started speaking in English and he didn't understand me, but I kind of understood him just because Dutch is similar to German.  
Speaker 1    00:14:06    Yeah. No, my father-in-law doesn't speak. Um, doesn't speak English or German.  
Speaker 0    00:14:12    Oh, but German sounds enough like English or like Dutch that he probably could have understood me and I could have understood him.  
Speaker 1    00:14:19    Yeah. That's that's usually what happens. My, my mother-in-law talking  
Speaker 0    00:14:26    Kinda like talking to someone from the south, you know, they don't really speak. You can understand him.  
Speaker 1    00:14:32    This is true. If you, if you do call here, you should ask for ask for my, and no one told you should ask to talk to my mother-in-law because she speaks English. Just fine. You'll have to talk slow, but she'll understand everything you say.  
Speaker 0    00:14:45    Okay.  
Speaker 1    00:14:46    It's it's deceptive. Cuz I mean, ID be talking. She understands everything.  
Speaker 0    00:14:50    It's right. Is that's on his maiden name?  
Speaker 1    00:14:53    Bode B  
Speaker 0    00:14:55    Bode. Okay.  
Speaker 1    00:14:57    And uh, let me give you the number it's um, if you're in Holland, okay. There's two numbers. If you're in Holland it's 0 3, 4 0 2. That's the area code.  
Speaker 0    00:15:13    Oh, of course. Yeah. But then it's only like a five digit number, right?  
Speaker 1    00:15:18    Yeah. It's five digits. It's 0 3, 4 0 2. And then the actual number's 8, 5 8.  
Speaker 0    00:15:29    I don't know. I may not be able to remember that one.  
Speaker 2    00:15:32    <laugh>  
Speaker 1    00:15:35    And yeah, if you speak, if you speak, uh, English to the secretary who answer, they will speak English back.  
Speaker 0    00:15:40    Okay.  
Speaker 1    00:15:41    Cause the company has an American division and so everybody has to speak English.  
Speaker 0    00:15:46    Oh great. So that works for you then?  
Speaker 1    00:15:50    No it doesn't. I have to speak Dutch during the work day.  
Speaker 2    00:15:53    <laugh>  
Speaker 1    00:15:54    They? The company language is Dutch because the company is Dutch owned, but it has affiliate. It has a, you know, it has a part, an American part. So everybody and in Holland, everybody speaks English anyway. So except on everybody speak. Well, yeah, older people don't but all the younger people are the professionals, they all speak English. All the textbooks for computer science are all in English for the most part.  
Speaker 0    00:16:21    What's what's your number? Outside of Holland.  
Speaker 1    00:16:24    Oh, just the, it was zero. It was 0 3, 4. Just knock off the zero. And it's 3, 4, 0, 2. And then it's all the same. So you only dial that first zero. If you're in the country and then the country number is 31.  
Speaker 0    00:16:40    So you dial 31, then 34, 0 2,  
Speaker 1    00:16:43    Right?  
Speaker 0    00:16:48    Hey, when you're calling the us, how do you, what do you dial? 0 1, 1 then 2 0 6, whatever. Then  
Speaker 1    00:16:55    The area,  
Speaker 1    00:16:57    If I were, if I were calling, like if I were gonna call you back, let's say yeah, yeah. Then what I would do is we have, I mean, it's a different different system here. Mm-hmm <affirmative> you have to, I would just dial, I think it's a America's country code is one. So I think we would dial one and then I don't know. There's there's some code I need to dial on the phone. I have no idea. What I usually do when I call America is use my at and T call direct Uhhuh at and T dial direct thing where I call a toll free number in Holland. And they put me straight through to an at and T operator mm-hmm <affirmative> and then they build me at American rates, which are about a third of the Dutch rates. Wow. And, and they bill my parents' house and then my parents pay it out of a bank account we have in America. So that's bit handier  
Speaker 2    00:17:47    <laugh>  
Speaker 0    00:17:49    Okay.  











Speaker 1    00:17:49    But uh, yeah, it's still, it's still fairly, it's still a fairly expensive call, but uh, but it's a lot less expensive if we do it that way than if we than if we actually make like my, my parents-in-law pay it, then it, the Dutch have such high taxes on those. They consider it a luxury to call around the world. So they tax it really high  
Speaker 1    00:18:11    Anyway. Um, so you guys will be in either the 18th or the 19th and you're gonna go to, uh, Amsterdam. What I would say is once you're at a hotel, mm-hmm <affirmative> um, why don't you call me at work and let me know where you are. And then we can make arrangements that day, um, that I can meet you in Amsterdam and maybe I'll come by public transport. It's probably easier for me to come by public transport and Amsterdam than it is for me to come by car. To be honest, mm-hmm <affirmative>, the streets are small and there's no parking. So I probably will come by public transport, but I don't know. We'll see where you're staying. Um, and there's a lot more for you guys. If you want to see stuff, you can see stuff in Amsterdam. And uh, since the days are really long, I mean, it stays light here till about 10 30, 11 o'clock mm-hmm <affirmative> at night. So if you want, we can, we can take a ride and go see stuff at night and I can take you to some places we can go see, uh, go see some stuff. Um, depends on what you guys want to see. So you guys should pick out the things you want to see and let me know.  
Speaker 1    00:19:17    Um, and I'll, I'll sit and talk with AYA about some things that maybe we think they'd be neat for you to see. So if you don't have any ideas, we'll put something together for you. Okay. Um, but yeah, but I can pick you up, you know, I'll probably be there sometime around six and we can like do, do a quick dinner or something and then go, uh, and then go, yeah, go see whatever you wanna see if you wanna stay in Amsterdam, that's fine. If you want to go, uh, off into the countryside somewhere and see a little bit of the Holland real Holland, we can do that too.  
Speaker 0    00:19:46    Actually, I I've been up to Holland before. It's been about two weeks  
Speaker 1    00:19:49    There. Yeah.
Speaker 0    00:19:50    So, um, but that was years and years ago  
Speaker 1    00:19:53    With your parents when your father was stationed over here, right?  
Speaker 0    00:19:56    Yeah. But we, we gotta see den hog and places like that too, which we're obviously not gonna see this time, but, um,  
Speaker 1    00:20:06    Has, has Kim been here  
Speaker 0    00:20:08    Before? No.  
Speaker 1    00:20:09    Okay.  
Speaker 0    00:20:11    But then again, I'm, I'm not sure that Kim would be interested in seeing shape headquarters and you know, all that kind of stuff.  
Speaker 2    00:20:19    <laugh>,  
Speaker 0    00:20:20    It's a military thing.  
Speaker 1    00:20:24    Would you be interested in seeing, seeing shape headquarters again?  
Speaker 0    00:20:27    No, not really. <laugh>  
Speaker 1    00:20:30    Yeah. I didn't, I didn't think so. Somehow I had this feeling that the, that the military taste had been beaten out of you <laugh> yep. I'm the mil. I can't say two bad things about the military though. They still have my goods and they'll probably hold them hostage and they own my body and soul for like another four years. So I just gotta play that thing. Yeah. I, I owe four years in active reserve time. All  
Speaker 0    00:20:56    Great. Did they do that to everyone? My,  
Speaker 1    00:21:00    Yeah. Everyone who, everyone who's, uh, who hasn't been like, you were, you went through like the 36, 2 process mm-hmm <affirmative> so you don't, you don't have it, but if, yeah, if you just separate normally and you haven't served at least eight years, then you owe it  
Speaker 0    00:21:15    And that's one of those things. They just never tell you front.  
Speaker 1    00:21:19    No, they never said anything. I figured there was something like that because, and  
Speaker 0    00:21:24    I was, I was in the inactive reserves the entire time I was in college too. So  
Speaker 1    00:21:29    Yeah. That's I mean, that's the military. I, I have my, my discharge papers and everything Uhhuh and I've, they I've I've said that. Yeah, I will give a urine sample or a blood sample if they, if they call me back for those, but they're gonna have to pay my trip back to the states. Cause there's no basis in Holland that I'm not gonna pay outta my own expenses to go to Germany or something for them. If they want me, they can pay, bring me back active duty and pay me for the day that they're gonna drag me off somewhere. But, uh, first they have to find me. Yeah, that's  
Speaker 0    00:22:02    Do is if you're in another country, I mean, and you're not planning on coming back to the us, what are, what are they gonna do? Even if you don't.  
Speaker 1    00:22:10    Yeah. Well, I mean, I still American citizen and I still would like to be welcome in my whole country, although yeah. I mean, if, if, if they denied my citizenship and I became a citizen here, I probably wouldn't be a horror either. But, uh, yeah, right now I'm, I mean, ID do want to keep my American citizenship. So I kind of wanna dual citizen what's  
Speaker 0    00:22:30    That? Are you gonna try and become a dual citizen, have  
Speaker 1    00:22:33    Dual citizen? You can't do, you can't do that. Um, the only way to be a dual citizen is if you're born in a foreign country, like if I were born in, in, in Holland and then when, and then had American parents, then I could be a dual citizen, but you can't. If I would ask to become a citizen in Holland, I would automatically lose my American citizenship  
Speaker 0    00:22:51    As far as the Americans are concerned. Yeah.  
Speaker 1    00:22:54    Yeah. The Dutch could care less. The Dutch would say fine. Wanna be a dual citizen. That's fine. But the Americans, as soon as you ask for another citizenship that act of asking for it takes away your American citizenship. It's kind of stupid.  
Speaker 0    00:23:09    Yeah.  
Speaker 1    00:23:12    So I'm a American re I'm a, I'm an expatriate, an American expatriate, an American living abroad. <laugh> I still have to file a tax return. Do you? Yeah, but my first $75,000 worth of income is tax free. Okay. As long as I don't bring it back to the states.  
Speaker 0    00:23:31    Good grief IRS for you, huh?  
Speaker 1    00:23:34    Yeah. <laugh> oh, they want their share. They want their piece of meat, but all foreign taxes are deductible. And my taxes here are 50% of income. So the taxes here are so much higher that yeah. I would never have to worry about it.  
Speaker 0    00:23:50    <laugh> unless you became CEO of the company, then, then maybe like a thousand dollars should be taxable, right?  
Speaker 1    00:23:57    Yeah. Some outrageously small amount. The problem's gonna be, the problem is gonna be, uh, be on you's American salary is taxable here and at 50%. So we're going to owe some money to the Dutch government on her salary. Oh. Some amount that has, as we deducted a certain amount and the amount we pay the American government is deductible, but will still owe some taxes. So I don't know how it works. We're gonna need to some, we're gonna give some sort of account and do it. Cause I have no clue how that all works.  
Speaker 0    00:24:28    They don't have the quick and Dutch version.  
Speaker 1    00:24:31    Yeah. <laugh> I, you know, I wouldn't trust it because it's so complicated with this international garbage or, or else the  
Speaker 0    00:24:39    Turbo tax with the, the Dutch modules.  
Speaker 1    00:24:42    Yeah. Somehow I just wouldn't trust it. I don't know. Yeah. It's a little complicated when you're dealing with a Dutch tax form on, you had to read it in onion, her father didn't understand the damn thing. How am I supposed to understand it?  
Speaker 0    00:24:54    I'm really looking forward to moving to Oregon and dealing with Oregon. You pay state tax Washington. You don't, I'm looking forward to that. Cuz  
Speaker 1    00:25:01    You'll, you'll be a, you'll be a student. So you, I mean, what, what is your income?  
Speaker 0    00:25:07    Oh, well see, I think, um, it'll probably be about $5,000 for the, for the portion next year that I'm in Oregon or the portion of this year that I'm in Oregon and then next year it'll be 11,000.  
Speaker 1    00:25:19    Yeah. But you'll be below. I mean you're below the poverty line at that level. Yeah. So I mean any income that you  
Speaker 0    00:25:27    Well, but then I've already made, say like 15,000 or whatever here in Washington, but  
Speaker 1    00:25:33    That should be non-taxable out-of-state income.  
Speaker 0    00:25:36    It should, but you know, it, it just, it's not gonna be a fun tax return here.  
Speaker 1    00:25:41    <laugh> I had that when I went into the military <laugh> I had can, I had to file three tax. I had to file Georgia, Kansas and yeah. And then my federal so,  
Speaker 0    00:25:57    Well, um, actually I think this phone call's just about to end cuz it's only half an hour, but um, so let's see, I'll give you a call when we arrive in or maybe I'll just call you when we get in Holland just to let you know we're there. So if we get in the 18th or the 19th and then call you back when, um, when we get to a hotel or something like that.  
Speaker 1    00:26:17    Okay. That's a, that's a great idea. If you, if, as soon as you get into Holland and you get yourself settled, you can call me. And uh, if I'm, if it's at night, just call parents.  
Speaker 0    00:26:28    Okay.  
Speaker 1    00:26:28    So, and remember if you dial in Holland, you need to add a zero. So like right now it's okay. It's 1 8 1 0 area code. If you dial in Holland it's 0 1 8 1 0 in Holland. Okay. And, and then yeah, you can, can just call up if, if it's, if it's during the work hours, fine, call me at work. If not call on his parents, if you don't have a new phone number for me and if you do, I'll send it by email. If I get it before this weekend, I'll, we'll email you something. But if you don't get emailed and just call on his parents, if we have a phone by then, they'll be able to give you the number and just remember to ask for her mother  
Speaker 0    00:27:04    And it's bood, right?  
Speaker 1    00:27:07    Bode,  
Speaker 0    00:27:08    Bode,  
Speaker 1    00:27:10    Bood, as in, uh, a bode minus B a.  
Speaker 0    00:27:13    Okay, great.  
Speaker 1    00:27:20    And yeah, and I think, uh, it's, it's not FRA it's AI it's uh, it's Mora. Mara is the, uh, is FRA and German. It's FRA mm-hmm <affirmative> and then Dutch it's Mora.  
Speaker 0    00:27:36    Oh, probably never remember that. So,  
Speaker 1    00:27:37    Nah, don't worry about it. You can just call her misses. You can just call her misses and speak English to her. She'll she understands just talk slowly and clearly. Okay. And once you're in Holland, the line will be really clear. I mean, the phones here are pretty good. Once you're in the country, it's just these over, over America to America, it's always kind of iffy.  
Speaker 0    00:27:57    Okay.  
Speaker 1    00:27:58    But I look forward to seeing you guys.  
Speaker 0    00:28:00    Yeah, we do too.  
Speaker 1    00:28:02    And uh, yeah. Well once, uh, job,  
Speaker 0    00:28:05    Congratulations getting your job there.  
Speaker 1    00:28:07    Thanks a lot.  
Speaker 0    00:28:08    Sure.  
Speaker 1    00:28:09    Yeah. And uh, yeah. Well, I'll get to see you guys at some point and, and we'll hook up and maybe we can go for a drive the country or whatever you guys want to do. Um, pick out some places and I'll talk to Onya about some things that you, you can see, you know, if you don't have any ideas and maybe we can go for dinner in the country or something or okay. You know, so what was the company by the country? I mean, what's that?  
Speaker 0    00:28:30    What was the company car? Did they give you a Ferrari?  
Speaker 1    00:28:33    Yeah. Right. Fat chance. I got a Mitsubishi cult.  
Speaker 0    00:28:36    They didn't even give you a Dutch car or a European car.  
Speaker 1    00:28:40    I don't really want an European or a Dutch car. I'm very happy with the Mitsubishi. Actually.  
Speaker 0    00:28:45    You wouldn't want Mercedes. Yeah.  
Speaker 1    00:28:47    It's a, oh no. If they gave me a Mercedes, that would be fine. But uh, I don't think the company's gonna be giving me a Mercedes or a BMW anytime real soon. <laugh> but it does work on, on like LPG, liquid, propane gas.  
Speaker 0    00:29:00    Oh, does it?  
Speaker 1    00:29:02    And uh, yeah. And Gasol and regular gasoline. So it's always, it's kind of interesting. It's kind of interesting experience, but um, yeah, it's a nice little car. It's nothing special, but it came with a radio, which is kind of not standard here in Holland.  
Speaker 0    00:29:15    Oh yeah. And the other thing, it probably gets good gas mileage, which is really important over there. Isn't it? Four bucks a gallon.  
Speaker 1    00:29:21    Well, yeah, right now it's not getting good gas mileage cuz it's in its break in period. Oh. And I have to, and I have to use gasoline, but once I switch over to liquid propane gas, the cost is the same as gas in America.  
Speaker 0    00:29:35    Oh  
Speaker 1    00:29:36    Yeah. So liquid propane is a lot cheaper, but, or liquid petrol gas. I don't know what the hell this stuff is. It's propane, I think, but <laugh>, I don't know. All I know is this, this, this different hookup I have not had not yet used because I have to burn it in with regular benne. Benzene is gas or gas, American gas. And uh, so I'm working my way into it. But anyway,
