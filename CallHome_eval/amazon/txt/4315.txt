spk_0:  I'm doing good I was going to Susan's back and forth and my sister is back and forth
spk_1:  This
spk_0:  is the way this week when I'm going to my sisters tomorrow she needs a babysitter on thursday
spk_1:  Yeah so I'm going tomorrow
spk_0:  but I feel like I thought
spk_1:  she was going away for vacation this week away now Oh she's way
spk_0:  back tonight
spk_1:  Yeah
spk_0:  Yeah So um I feel like this always happens when I get towards the end and I have this list of things to get
spk_0:  you know like Georgia has a little list and I have to bring for him his wife and his kids
spk_1:  to bring
spk_0:  back to the
spk_1:  list I would bring her back anything
spk_0:  Oh my gosh did I tell you about this episode before I left
spk_1:  Yeah you told me
spk_0:  She said well I just can't you know you have to pretend sometimes just a little like makeup type of case You know you have to go away a little makeup and sanitary pad and then I said to myself Oh my God maybe she doesn't have a period anymore It's like almost 50
spk_0:  this will
spk_1:  be a funny conversation to listen
spk_0:  to a little perfume inside of it I can't go and give everybody you know I am not going to break off my relationship with him because of
spk_1:  her doing shopping
spk_0:  around sneakers I didn't get them yet and I got to get George some stuff for the video
spk_1:  camera She gave
spk_0:  me such a list including sneakers and her I can't bring the sneakers back
spk_0:  Because I'm going I don't want to take an extra suitcase with me I got to pay $90 for an extra suitcase And George said no I want some back and I bought two extra and they just let me go but I can't take that chance They might not let me What am I going to do
spk_1:  The baby is not allowed
spk_0:  to carry on
spk_0:  So
spk_1:  um once you come with one suitcase no I
spk_0:  was an idiot I came with two but I came with a regular one and the regular one inside of the big one So what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna leave the small ones here and take my mother's big ones I have two big ones
spk_1:  That's a good idea
spk_0:  because they really see I'm doing Michelle I'm getting smart Michelle Very practical
spk_1:  Um
spk_0:  The
spk_1:  other thing is instead of taking one of your mother's if she doesn't you know want to relinquish it or whatever you buy you go to the supermarket and you get a pampers
spk_0:  cotton and
spk_1:  you just load it up and then you just throw the carton away
spk_0:  You know she doesn't care I'm leaving her mind
spk_0:  and she's giving me this one doesn't doesn't matter for
spk_1:  me Yeah I told you I says if you need things why don't you start shopping around Don't wait till the last God
spk_0:  no she
spk_1:  can't She's
spk_0:  got kids and I'm going with the baby all the time she
spk_1:  left today She said she was going out of her mind you know look at my mother
