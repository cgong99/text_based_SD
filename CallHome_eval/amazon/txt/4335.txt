spk_1:  let's
spk_0:  see here House wear shoes Jeffrey bean harry and David I don't know what that is jockey
spk_0:  jones of new york And then they've got a couple of other places They
spk_1:  never get places but they never do
spk_0:  never get
spk_1:  what Ow brand of jeans that he likes
spk_0:  Uh No that's not
spk_1:  never It's one of the things like whenever store has a sale of
spk_1:  20% off anything or something it's always excluded You
spk_0:  know the girls have never bought that
spk_1:  Voice thing
spk_0:  Okay because I've never heard of talk about that And I've got legs and leave eyes music for a song track here
spk_1:  I
spk_0:  bought Chocolate Factory
spk_1:  Daddy said he said
spk_0:  no no we
spk_1:  don't want to go anywhere We just want to sit around and
spk_0:  talk
spk_1:  and I said we have to see her too It's really cool It's got the jungle and the penguins Okay
spk_0:  I mean I want to do some of
spk_1:  that But you know Yeah
spk_0:  I mean I have to go to
spk_1:  the plastic
spk_0:  things
spk_1:  we
spk_0:  have to go there Well even at the beach you know who's the one who always wants to go to or he
spk_1:  feels like he needs to entertain entertain down
spk_0:  there But
spk_1:  he gets tired He
spk_0:  gets tired but he likes to go to
spk_0:  I figured he loves that nelson art
spk_1:  gallery
spk_0:  So I figured we'll go down and I haven't been there for quite a while and they all they changed it a lot
spk_1:  exhibits and stuff
spk_0:  So I thought we'd go down there and have lunch in that uh Atrium type deal they have there and
spk_1:  she doesn't want to go like for a whole day necessarily but if you go someplace part of the day I think that breaks it
spk_0:  right Yeah that's kind of what I figured we do And then
spk_1:  a letter from money yesterday
spk_0:  interesting
spk_1:  stuff
spk_0:  Oh really
spk_1:  Just a little bit
spk_0:  She
spk_1:  told you that or not about how they had an offer in their house and stuff
spk_0:  Yeah she did tell me they had an offer because I called her to talk to about the plane
spk_1:  tickets
spk_0:  and um
spk_1:  I
spk_0:  said well what are they asking for the house and she didn't know she just needed the offer was 30,000
spk_1:  dollars below but time told me they were asking 2 60
spk_0:  Oh really
spk_1:  Yeah
spk_1:  2 59 I can't remember what he said He said they had it like
spk_1:  at 2 60 the agents that they should put it like 2 59 9 or something So that because some people you know I thought they should probably put it like to be below 2 50 would be a normal cut off place for a lot more people you know
spk_1:  And
spk_0:  Well but the thing about that some people look a little higher than an offer 250 you know Um that is so noisy I hate it when the girls do that when I'm on the phone the ice maker I mean it just sounds like an earthquake you can't hear a thing when that's on um what did they pay for the house
spk_1:  What
spk_0:  did they pay
spk_1:  too
spk_1:  About 2 20
spk_0:  five or something And then
spk_1:  they put in the pool
spk_0:  Yeah
spk_1:  And she said she said it was 20 below their bottom line so apparently they're willing to go down 10 But to me the freaking thing I mean I mean they had an offer they should jump on it
spk_0:  I mean I mean when you look at what happened to his house and they can take that loss on their taxes
spk_1:  Yeah
spk_0:  You know I mean you can recoup probably even
spk_1:  be a loss I don't know what the pool cost but it'll probably be about
spk_1:  that would be lost
spk_0:  Yeah they would take a loss on it But like I said you can write that off too on your taxes and um because when
spk_1:  you think would be wanting to get rid of it because
spk_0:  she's
spk_1:  paying gets to live there So
spk_0:  I know well I know when um
spk_0:  mitch sold his stock to get the money and build their house he had to sell at a loss and we've taken that loss on the tax return I think next year So last year we get to take it and he said that'll really hurt us when we get to take
spk_1:  that anymore
spk_0:  and I forget you can take some x number of dollars a
spk_1:  year
spk_0:  Yeah you can stretch it out and that'll be gone But you know that's kind of a nice especially if he's going to be a single person
spk_1:  and he
spk_1:  I said neither one of them in files for divorce and then that wasn't an issue the main thing was selling the house first and then we could get the rest of it in order Something about that julie is really butch stout I guess she's got her hair cut
spk_0:  shorter
spk_1:  than man you know shorter than a lot of
spk_0:  man's you
spk_1:  know and she's so funny when she writes something about she thought Susan was the man in the relationship and then she said I don't know much about this Can both doesn't beat men
spk_1:  which is kind of funny
spk_0:  jeez well Susan definitely wants to be a
spk_1:  man that short
spk_0:  God it sounds like a man too jesus
spk_1:  who knows maybe they can both be
spk_0:  I guess so That is just so bizarre But like I said I think the red flags were there all along and we chose to ignore them because we wanted happiness
spk_1:  Oh yeah that was my very first thought and I thought oh don't be so mean don't even say that
spk_0:  you know
spk_1:  looked out that window and they were in the backyard and it took me a minute to decide
spk_0:  which one was
spk_1:  hot like hmm
spk_0:  well I'll never forget that night when they were before the wedding when she said when she mentioned that girlfriend and how you know she thought you know this girlfriend works that they could be friends anymore and she told her that was still and I thought why she told me about a girlfriend Yeah I remember then you
spk_1:  know I mean all
spk_0:  the little bells went off in my head but I just thought no no no no you know I
spk_1:  know there's a lady in our office who was married and got divorced and
spk_1:  her last kids is graduating from high school and she was talking about that she was going to sell her house and get a small place and she wanted to be out in the country and blah blah
spk_0:  blah and
spk_1:  um
spk_1:  I've seen a year or so ago at a restaurant with a lady and you know and they acted guilty when you saw them you know
spk_0:  it's one of those
spk_1:  things
spk_0:  and it
spk_1:  was this saturday night but it was kind of like she was a small restaurant
spk_0:  that
spk_1:  other people picked it but it was like way out of the way and not a place I've ever been before I ever heard of and and there she was and so she kind of it was it was just a little different than
spk_0:  you
spk_1:  know and I thought that's kind of strange and then I thought they they kind of looked like they were you know pretty close and stuff and
spk_1:  so anyway then my secretary told me the other day said oh Miranda was in today did you know She bought a house I said well should we
spk_0:  talk in the spring
spk_1:  and she said something she was going to and stuff and she said she bought it with another lady said oh and I told her about seeing her in the restaurant and how they acted kind of weird stuff and she said I always kind of wondered about her because she was a real man hater She just figured it was because she went through a bad divorce She really did he ran around and he had another woman and
spk_0:  you know kind
spk_1:  of a bad deal for her So
spk_1:  but anyways you know it just all makes sense like you said the little signals were kind of there but you just think oh that's you know don't jump to conclusions because the ladies out with another woman
spk_0:  you know that
spk_1:  doesn't mean she's a lesbian or anything And then I really thought even if they live together I suppose they don't necessarily have to have a sexual relationship
spk_0:  and I thought of
spk_1:  doing that before and I still think if something happened to ted later on and they had a woman friend that I enjoyed and stuff I wouldn't
spk_0:  be
spk_1:  opposed to
spk_1:  place together something expensive and having a companion and stuff and it would mean we were sleeping together
spk_0:  but each to their own it's just too bad taught had to be caught in
spk_1:  something and get messed up with all that
spk_0:  I guess he's still going to church every sunday I stopped buying his way to church or something and
spk_0:  so I don't know maybe you can find somebody else
spk_1:  church you know I think that would be better and then quit going over to see your parents and stuff I think that's just kind of prolonging
spk_0:  it is but I think you
spk_1:  need that you do it so you
spk_0:  don't need it right you have to go graduated
spk_1:  and when I don't know when that's not right for him anymore
spk_1:  Yeah brother but I could be doing fine so it was just kind of interesting and then she hurts me stuff about Mary brakeman
spk_0:  Oh really
spk_1:  I gotta get this just right over here this is for you to just take a second
spk_1:  I thought I had everything here after my call but I had my and everything um I'll be here I forgot this letter She said um
spk_1:  I went out to see Mary last week they moved her from the therapy department to a regular room in her room She is a black woman Mary was out at the nurse's station waiting for Bill and Leslie and to pick her up and take her home They told me she's been doing the first couple of days she didn't know me and kept asking where I thought she should wait then she asked me to take her home And I told her I couldn't then she wanted me to call them and see when they were coming Finally I tried to explain they weren't coming And she asked who isn't coming
spk_0:  So
spk_1:  my heart heavy I told her I had to go and left I had tried to get her to go back to her room but she kept asking me why I said that was her room So sad I surely hope I never end up in that state If I do don't ever come see me and break your heart But don't you remember me As I was not in that condition No trying to see if she said anything else about
spk_1:  God
spk_1:  Um Oh yeah she said he was going up to Baltimore for a week So
spk_0:  she she she told me that
spk_1:  they have
