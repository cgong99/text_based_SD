spk_0:  and they still have this one daughter
spk_1:  Yes And I think that's probably all because um I think carl feels like people like me overpopulate
spk_0:  the
spk_1:  world
spk_0:  I have three
spk_1:  friends now
spk_0:  Realty Yeah All boys
spk_1:  Yes
spk_0:  no girl Oh my God
spk_0:  Oh that's so interesting And you know Jasmine Jasmine and Sophie are taking swimming classes with Winston And I was yeah and I was thinking about asking him for your address and I thought no he's so forgetful he'll never remember It's not worth it he never would or
spk_1:  he
spk_0:  wouldn't know how to you know he wouldn't know how to
spk_1:  get it
spk_0:  I really well just
spk_1:  just Winston I know you
spk_0:  know I used to call him every
spk_1:  once in a while but
spk_0:  their niece
spk_1:  like I think she's the oldest of all this
spk_1:  of all the kids the one who's I don't know if you know much about the family but the one whose father got killed in Nicaragua fighting But anyway um
spk_0:  she was living
spk_1:  in the house and she's kind of
spk_1:  I don't know I don't I don't know
spk_0:  if she would have been
spk_1:  this way she hadn't had all the problems she had in her life but she's kind of a goofball and she ran up such big bills but I don't think they've had a phone for a whole year because he came off but
spk_1:  and I
spk_0:  don't know if she's not
spk_1:  living there or not
spk_0:  but I can
spk_1:  give you my
spk_0:  address Yeah I'm so good You know how I have your
spk_1:  number I
spk_0:  was wondering about that No no well I did talk to her but she didn't give well actually she wasn't
spk_1:  there the day I called I talked to well but um the
spk_0:  last time I was in
spk_1:  which is nearing two years it's gonna be two years in january Um
spk_1:  I saw
spk_0:  your husband
spk_1:  as I was leaving the airport and I
spk_0:  had my
spk_1:  billfold out and he wrote it on this
spk_0:  card and my bill folder you know what I don't have a lot of things but I still have that Oh my god I don't remember
spk_1:  So
spk_0:  uh and I don't remember him telling me that he saw you so he
spk_1:  probably
spk_0:  space that he
spk_1:  was I
spk_0:  think he was in
spk_1:  the middle of some kind of work project or something they're
spk_0:  picking up people from corporate
spk_1:  like that Yeah but
spk_0:  that was right out I mean that's a
spk_1:  long time ago that was right after the um the change of the government we were down because of that
spk_0:  Oh
spk_1:  anyway
spk_1:  so
spk_0:  three boys barb my hands remember you said last time that the doctor said that you had to have a baby
spk_1:  because of your ovaries
spk_0:  or whatever just to keep everything in order I should
spk_1:  do it you
spk_0:  know And so that's what it was pushed
spk_1:  me he
spk_0:  said that we don't want you to
spk_1:  have a baby if it's gonna create problems but if you want to have one this is the time and it actually did turn everything around for me I don't know if it works that way for everybody but those hormones kind of took care of
spk_1:  the problems I was having I was starting to have the problem again before Like it was only maybe three months afterwards I got pregnant but I could already feel the pains and all that So I felt so good when I was pregnant I just felt like it was a miracle
spk_0:  Oh
spk_1:  yeah And then breastfeeding those also help So I feel just fine I hope I hope I never have to deal with again But who knows After
spk_0:  3 So your first boy is Joel
spk_1:  or no no no no no He's a half that's how long ago that was
spk_0:  seven And we haven't seen each other in a long time because
spk_1:  thomas
spk_0:  is
spk_1:  three
spk_1:  Uh Huh And then I have a baby who's gonna turn 10 months
spk_0:  And what's the
spk_1:  biggest name That's Logan Andreas
spk_0:  Oh how
spk_1:  nice And
spk_0:  so you're gonna keep going or well
spk_1:  I thought I was done really after
spk_0:  time It's not
spk_1:  that I think two is the perfect number but I didn't expect to get pregnant a third time Like it just kinda that happened when I was in
spk_0:  I was really
spk_1:  so
spk_1:  I was so angry at Oscar that I just knew there was no way that I could never even think of going to bed
spk_0:  And that's when it happens
spk_0:  I love my little
spk_1:  baby
spk_0:  and you're still with Oscar right That's well we're
spk_1:  still married but he's doing his own thing like usual So I pretty much take care of the crew alone He calls to see how they're doing and pops in every once in a while But it's tough It really is too She
spk_0:  does Well she has
spk_1:  since
spk_1:  well I
spk_0:  think they've been here
spk_1:  five years now five
spk_0:  years this
spk_1:  Summer because we were figuring that they can apply for citizenship both after And um he's funny and she just turned 18 now
spk_0:  he
spk_1:  doesn't live here Um
spk_1:  he had kind of well it's a long long story but um at
spk_0:  one
spk_1:  point when I got real irritated with Oscar everybody in the family insisted that I was an idiot and I should make him take care of his
spk_0:  Children
spk_1:  which you
spk_0:  know I really believe I was there I mean it does
spk_1:  make a lot of
spk_1:  intellectual sense I guess but
spk_0:  you really
spk_1:  I didn't want to do that to the kids but I did and so I sent them to stay with him and then
spk_1:  I felt bad about it immediately and then he wouldn't let him come back And so it turned into a situation where he was really the one that wanted to come back and ask you kind of um
spk_1:  decided that living with his father was what he wanted
spk_0:  And his mom used to beg him
spk_1:  to let her come back and he'd say yes then he hang up the phone and I never let you go back
spk_0:  there You know I mean it was real fun but it wasn't really that
spk_1:  he
spk_0:  wanted her around
spk_1:  but it was just I don't know people do stupid things
spk_0:  so so they're living with him no Um now how long probably two years ago
spk_1:  then
spk_1:  we she and I worked it out well I got power of attorney from her mom because my mom always had custody
spk_1:  and
spk_0:  she called me
spk_1:  one day when
spk_1:  there was nobody in the house but her and I drove and got her and kind of stole her back
spk_0:  It was kind of exciting Oh my god I believe that I never do that when I was
spk_1:  very exciting actually because
spk_0:  I
spk_1:  mean I had to drive like 2.5 hours so we know you didn't know at any moment somebody might be coming home I said
spk_0:  get your stuff ready and I called him when I got to the corner you know it was it was really something
spk_1:  And we just packed the car floor I mean there wasn't one
spk_0:  space left and then we just flew out of there and
spk_1:  we went to the nearest Mcdonald's to kind of repack where we could
spk_0:  breathe funny and then you know he never
spk_1:  said a thing about it
spk_0:  you know
spk_1:  I
spk_0:  know that
spk_1:  he knew she was better off here
spk_0:  and she had
spk_1:  told me that she almost committed suicide once but
spk_0:  you know he doesn't even
spk_1:  know any of it because he doesn't care about his kids but he's not really capable
spk_0:  of
spk_1:  father You know
spk_0:  what I'm doing is she's studying or did she already graduated high school She's gonna be
spk_1:  in her last year of high school and she's been with her mom for two months so she'll be coming back tomorrow
spk_1:  Um
spk_0:  So
spk_1:  that's that's what we have here And then Oscar
spk_0:  junior
spk_1:  has in
spk_0:  the last year he was he
spk_1:  graduated one year ago from high school and he started going to school in Missouri and
spk_1:  then
spk_0:  this out
spk_1:  of the blue he told me that he and his buddy wanted to move back to Omaha and go to school here which is really surprising And then he was kind of saying that living with his father wasn't what he you know kind of had
spk_1:  his opinion on it has had changed but they wanted to in an apartment they didn't want to burden me anymore where his words but you know I know they
spk_0:  were they were on friday which is great
spk_1:  There 20 you know so they
spk_0:  just moved
spk_1:  In about '04 blocks maybe farther
spk_0:  about
spk_1:  a mile from us They loved wow and that's
spk_0:  gonna be
spk_1:  really help It's gonna be nice His
spk_0:  buddy
spk_1:  is actually asked her is finishing some work that he was doing and then he's coming up something next week
spk_1:  but that
spk_0:  that's kind of
spk_1:  in a nutshell
spk_1:  wow things
spk_0:  that have
spk_1:  been going on
spk_0:  That's interesting are you working are you teaching
spk_1:  Let's see
spk_0:  when I came
spk_1:  back I taught adult basic education because it was really hard to get a job at home which
spk_1:  probably still that way And I went for my Master's in counseling
spk_1:  Uh huh
spk_1:  Um
spk_1:  Actually I was asked to come back and be a counselor at the American school and that was the year I was pregnant with Noel and I was really torn I didn't know
spk_0:  what to do but my doctor didn't want
spk_1:  me to go back to hundreds because I've been so
spk_0:  sick
spk_1:  before he felt that I really needed we didn't know how the pregnancy was gonna go but I I
spk_0:  feel like
spk_1:  I really I
spk_0:  mean I wasn't
spk_1:  really paying that much attention to what he said but that did influence a little bit
spk_1:  so
spk_0:  I didn't go and uh let's
spk_1:  see
spk_0:  I guess I was
spk_1:  working part time that year doing part time counseling jobs And then that next year I had
spk_0:  two I
spk_1:  had one offer that I had to take the other one was were waiting for a principle to come back Um
spk_0:  But I ended
spk_1:  up I
spk_0:  wanted to go into high
spk_1:  school counseling but I couldn't because the principal was out on this boat they told me and he had to make the decision is like
spk_0:  I need to need to know fast because I'm pregnant and I cannot
spk_1:  you know risk losing a job
spk_0:  So I work in the community college which wasn't what
spk_1:  I wanted at the time But
spk_0:  as it
spk_1:  turned out it probably was the best Um And I like it real well I I was counseled for about five years and now I'm in administration Um
