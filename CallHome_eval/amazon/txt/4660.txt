spk_1:  directors um travel to the cities but the volunteers are in and
spk_1:  um you know meet with the Communities and stuff like that
spk_0:  with your area
spk_1:  Then I
spk_0:  go to
spk_1:  Kansas City Saint Louis de Moines And then I also have the community here in Detroit
spk_0:  So that's cool So yeah I
spk_1:  I know
spk_0:  it's so good to go so many times I go I go once in the fall for a week to each
spk_1:  city and then once in the
spk_0:  spring
spk_1:  so late
spk_0:  winter I
spk_1:  guess Um
spk_1:  So
spk_0:  when I go
spk_1:  in
spk_0:  october I go
spk_1:  first to Kansas City then to Saint Louis then
spk_0:  I came back to Detroit and we
spk_1:  have our um
spk_1:  our
spk_0:  fall retreat
spk_1:  is in the Iowa So that's in the middle of my area visits And then
spk_1:  then I go to
spk_0:  then I do my visit
spk_1:  then I go to but
spk_0:  the way it works out
spk_1:  for Kansas City and Saint Louis I
spk_0:  go to Kansas City and at the end of the week it's my birthday So I spent the morning of my birthday with Lisa and then I fly to Saint
spk_1:  Louis and spend
spk_0:  the afternoon
spk_1:  with Chris
spk_0:  or lou or whoever I
spk_1:  hook up with in Saint Louis So I'm like wow
spk_0:  that worked out pretty
spk_1:  cool Yeah so
spk_0:  So it sounds like you're gonna be gone a lot Yeah From October six
spk_1:  through through
spk_0:  thanksgiving
spk_1:  I'm here like
spk_1:  I don't know 10 days
spk_0:  or something
spk_1:  like that um
spk_0:  for thanksgiving
spk_1:  I don't know yet Um I'm going home in September for just a a three day weekend or something like that Um Because
spk_0:  September is pretty
spk_1:  much the
spk_0:  one of the slowest
spk_1:  month on the job so and
spk_0:  I haven't been to
spk_1:  texas in a while so I thought that would work out And um then at christmas time
spk_1:  I think two of my because
spk_0:  Well one of my
spk_1:  cousins um is getting married near Kansas city and I'm hoping my family will just come up to Kansas for that and then I'll go there and see them I don't know about thanksgiving yet
spk_1:  It's too far
spk_0:  away
spk_1:  to figure out So
spk_1:  anyway I will be nice
spk_0:  Are you happy
spk_1:  Yeah
spk_0:  I am
spk_1:  I it
spk_0:  was really hard
spk_1:  to make the decision I
spk_1:  actually
spk_0:  at one point decided
spk_1:  no I'm not gonna go I just like I don't think I want to start over again and I'm I'm liking being
spk_0:  in Omaha
spk_1:  and all that sort of thing And so
spk_1:  I called and told the director you know I thought about it a lot blah blah blah but I don't think it's
spk_1:  right for me right now and he was like
spk_0:  I don't
spk_1:  know him very well but uh he he had strep
spk_0:  throat when I was here and he wasn't feeling well like
spk_1:  well
spk_0:  okay and
spk_1:  uh later
spk_0:  that morning
spk_1:  Kate called me at work and in Omaha Aw
spk_1:  I'm like are you calling
spk_0:  to make this really hard on me
spk_1:  She's like
spk_0:  we just want you to
spk_1:  think about one more thing and
spk_0:  The job is supposed to be a two
spk_1:  year commitment But that was kind of like one of the things that I'm thinking I don't
spk_0:  know about doing it to your commitment and you know all this sort of thing No I mean it could be longer so it's not like it was too short it's just
spk_1:  you know I don't know I don't know what I was thinking but anyway
spk_0:  so like what if it was just a
spk_1:  one year
spk_0:  commitment
spk_1:  and
spk_1:  I'll think about it kind of threw me off and then
spk_1:  I I called later and I asked the director is um I said well would you be willing to
spk_0:  a first year
spk_1:  um Area
spk_0:  Director makes
spk_1:  17,000 in the second year Area director makes 18,501
spk_0:  year you get three weeks vacation so I can get four weeks and I said well would you be willing
spk_1:  to hire me as if I was coming in at the second year
spk_1:  at 18
spk_0:  five with 4 weeks
spk_1:  of vacation and he said yeah he would be willing to do that
spk_0:  wow that's a lot of
spk_1:  yeah it is which is
spk_0:  wonderful
spk_1:  that's
spk_0:  more important than money So we take we get the whole week from
spk_1:  christmas New
spk_0:  Year that's one of our weeks of vacation So it's only
spk_1:  you know in addition to that So
spk_1:  so anyway and
spk_0:  the rest you can take pretty much when you want
spk_1:  I mean
spk_0:  around your schedule which
spk_1:  is
spk_0:  in summer is not a really good time to
spk_1:  take it because
spk_1:  you're
spk_0:  Ending one Year and starting the next
spk_1:  year and you know doing
spk_0:  a lot with the volunteers
spk_1:  coming in
spk_0:  so I'll probably
spk_1:  try to take most of it before next summer
spk_1:  Um so
spk_0:  I thought about it that
spk_1:  day and ended up calling back and saying okay I'm coming to
spk_0:  Detroit So it's been really good since I actually I made the decision that
spk_1:  I thought oh
spk_0:  God what am I doing You know I I
spk_1:  just was still
spk_0:  unsure about it but within a couple of days I just felt really at peace
spk_1:  with it and
spk_0:  remained so throughout the time that I prepared to leave And
spk_1:  then
spk_1:  ever
spk_0:  since I've been here I keep thinking okay why am I so okay with this I'm gonna be falling apart any minute right You
spk_1:  know because
spk_0:  I used to transition hitting me a little bit harder especially when I was so ambivalent about the decision But
spk_1:  um I don't know it's been
spk_0:  great
spk_1:  So yeah
spk_0:  that's what I said finally um
spk_1:  I was telling somebody how you doing
spk_1:  I said well I'm
spk_0:  fine you know I keep wondering how long it's not laughing what's wrong And then finally I'm like you know I am just going to be okay that I'm okay and if I'm not okay later that's fine But right now I'm okay I have to stop wondering what it's gonna end
spk_1:  So
spk_1:  so that's kind of where I've been
spk_0:  So tell me about New York I got your
spk_1:  postcard Oh
spk_0:  new York was was really fun
spk_1:  Um I love
spk_0:  the city it
spk_1:  was I
spk_0:  don't know I didn't expect to
spk_1:  enjoy the city so much
spk_0:  You had been there before haven't you Just really briefly I
spk_1:  went to Long Island
spk_1:  for
spk_0:  a friend's wedding
spk_1:  and
spk_0:  my mortgage went together and
spk_1:  we we
spk_0:  took a train into the
spk_1:  city of cab to the
spk_0:  Metropolitan Museum of
spk_1:  Art
spk_0:  ran around there for an hour and a half took a cab back
spk_1:  and then the train back to Long
spk_0:  Island that's
spk_1:  all we saw Um
spk_0:  and I like that but it just it didn't even feel like I had actually
spk_1:  been in the city you know
spk_0:  So
spk_1:  um so
spk_0:  this was more like you know we we did a lot of
spk_1:  the
spk_0:  the touristy stuff
spk_1:  and
spk_1:  watching
spk_0:  the Brooklyn Bridge
spk_1:  and
spk_0:  took the ferry
spk_1:  and um watching several park and went
spk_0:  to a show and all that sort of stuff so it was really
spk_1:  fun Um And
spk_0:  we also went out
spk_1:  to to
spk_0:  Long
spk_1:  Island where joe's mom lives spent time
spk_0:  with the whole family which which was okay It was good when
spk_1:  we
spk_0:  were planning the trip
spk_1:  He
spk_0:  was like oh I hope we can go out
spk_1:  and you
spk_0:  know go to the beach
spk_1:  and you can
spk_1:  Meet my my brother and my nieces and nephew He's got four
spk_0:  Brothers three brothers um
spk_1:  two of them live on the island you know me and my brothers and my nieces and nephews and I'm like um I don't know I don't I said I think maybe we
spk_0:  need
spk_1:  time just to kind of
spk_0:  figure out where our relationship is before It's not that I don't wanna meet your family It's just
spk_1:  I
spk_0:  don't know I know his mom too and I think she's a little bit leery of the relationship based on what happened in the past you
spk_1:  know
spk_0:  and I heard her son and all that sort of thing I'm like
spk_1:  I just don't know if I'm
spk_0:  ready for
spk_1:  that and so
spk_0:  but it ended up happening that it was his brother's birthday and we were out there to go to the beach and
spk_1:  so I'm like okay we can you know I can handle this and uh it was very nice actually so that was fine and uh
spk_0:  I
spk_1:  don't know
spk_0:  um
spk_1:  it
spk_0:  was really fun and
spk_1:  I
spk_0:  mean in some ways though somebody I've known a long
spk_1:  time and I
spk_0:  know pretty well but in other ways like this is a whole new relationship So it's it's kind of weird to walk that
spk_1:  balance like
spk_0:  well you know one minute we're talking seriously like where would we live if we wanted to be together and then you know I'm like wait a minute I can't believe we're talking about this
spk_1:  now
spk_1:  he's in his last
spk_0:  year of graduate
spk_1:  school at calling the University is getting his masters in public administration
spk_0:  and he's been working with
spk_1:  this man
spk_0:  who is starting
spk_1:  a new nonprofit organization Um
spk_1:  He worked with him last summer and this summer and probably will work with him during the school year beyond
spk_0:  that He doesn't know what he's gonna do you
spk_1:  know But it's you know it's kind of
spk_0:  hard
spk_1:  because he might want
spk_0:  I mean chances are really good that he want to stay in New York or at least on the East Coast you know
spk_1:  kind
spk_0:  of interesting
spk_1:  politics
spk_0:  So D C Would
spk_1:  be an option and I don't know this
spk_0:  is hard because
spk_1:  that's
spk_0:  not really
spk_1:  where
spk_0:  I'm at But I mean we're both sort of like we don't know where life is taking
spk_1:  us and
spk_0:  hard to start a relationship when Yeah So what do we do
spk_1:  You know do we make decisions
spk_0:  based on each other I mean
spk_1:  just the
spk_0:  second we can we see each other So he's coming here over labor day
spk_1:  weekend And then
spk_0:  because my schedule gets
spk_1:  so crazy starting in the
spk_0:  middle of october
spk_1:  I'm going to go
spk_0:  there the first weekend of october That was kind of hard for us to decide
spk_1:  you
spk_0:  know he hasn't even been here yet I
spk_1:  Haven't seen him since 4th
spk_0:  of july weekend
spk_1:  And and we
spk_0:  decided well
spk_1:  you
spk_0:  know let's go
