E	5.79-6.2	 I guess
A	6.39-7.04	 OK we're on
A	10.38-12.37	 So just make sure that your wireless mike is on
A	12.57-13.72	 if you're wearing a wireless
E	12.82-14.54	 Check one Check one
A	18.29-22.84	 And you should be able to see which one which one you're on by uh watching the little bars change
B	23.82-25.29	 So which is my bar Mah
B	25.29-28.57	 Number one
A	26.42-26.56	 Yep
E	27.48-30.35	 Sibilance Sibilance
A	31.38-35.53	 So actually if you guys wanna go ahead and read digits now as long as you've signed the consent form that alright
E	35.49-37.01	 Are we supposed to read digits at the same time
A	37.28-37.46	 No
E	37.84-38.18	 Oh OK
A	38.14-43.61	 No Each individually We're talking about doing all at the same time but I think cognitively that would be really difficult
A	45.33-46.93	 To try to read them while everyone else is
E	46.33-47.96	 Everyone would need extreme focus
A	48.2-53.13	 So when you're reading the digit strings the first thing to do is just say which transcript you're on
C	50.16-51.18	 Other way
C	52.89-53.28	 We
C	53.28-54.54	 We may wind up with
C	54.61-56.66	 We we may need versions of all this garbage
B	57.19-58.2	 For our stuff Yeah
C	58.07-58.26	 Yeah
A	58.9-59.23	 Um
A	59.39-62.35	 So the first thing you'd wanna do is just say which transcript you're on So
C	59.72-60.56	 Yeah
A	62.65-66.44	 You can see the transcript There two large number strings on the digits
A	66.44-68.42	 So you would just read that one
A	68.42-71.97	 And then you read each line with a small pause between the lines
A	72.44-79.4	 And the pause is just so the person transcribing it can tell where one line ends and the other begins And I'll give I'll read the digit strings first so can see how that goes
A	81.14-83.78	 Um
A	88.19-90.59	 Again I'm not sure how much I should talk about
A	90.59-91.91	 stuff before everyone here
C	93.44-95.02	 Mmm Well we have one more coming
A	95.05-95.64	 OK
A	96.03-98.45	 Well why don't I go ahead and read digit strings and then we can go on from there
A	98.89-102.23	 So this is transcript three six five one three six seven

A	326.12-327.38	 Thanks
A	327.42-330.34	 So uh just also a note on wearing the microphones All of you look like you're
A	330.5-334.38	 doing it reasonably correctly but you want it about two thumb widths away from your mouth
A	334.8-335.9	 and then at the corner
A	336.4-338.34	 And that so that you minimize breath sounds
A	339.02-341.05	 so that when you're breathing you don't breathe into the mike
A	341.64-341.97	 Um
A	343.29-343.99	 Yeah that good
A	344.59-345.55	 And uh
A	346.94-348.17	 So everyone needs to fill out
A	348.47-351.34	 only once the speaker form and the consent form
A	351.89-353.19	 And the short form
A	353.65-355.2	 I mean you should read the consent form but
A	355.43-358.06	 uh the thing to notice is that we will give you an opportunity
A	358.63-360.18	 to edit all the transcripts
A	360.58-364.29	 So if you say things and you don't want them to be released to the general public
A	364.78-367.98	 which these will be available at some point to anyone who wants them
A	368.33-368.74	 uh
A	369.02-370.87	 you'll be given an opportunity by email
A	371.25-373.83	 uh to bleep out any portions you don't like
A	374.53-374.95	 Um
A	375.93-378.93	 On the speaker form just fill out as much of the information as you can
A	379.22-381.03	 If you're not exactly sure about the region
A	381.42-385.59	 we're not exactly sure either So don't worry too much about it The It just self rating
A	386.41-386.83	 Um
A	388.88-389.81	 And I think that about it
A	390.58-391.47	 I mean should I
A	391.47-394.73	 Do you want me to talk at all about why we're doing this and what this project is or
C	393.73-396.54	 Um yeah No There was there was Let see
C	396.6-397.57	 Oh
E	396.68-397.97	 Does Nancy know that we're meeting in here
C	398.72-401.36	 She got an she was notified
B	398.77-399.43	 I sent an email
E	400.32-401.68	 Oh yeah she got an Yeah yeah
C	401.67-404.34	 Whether she knows is another question
C	404.74-405.65	 Um
C	407.1-409.49	 So are the people going to be identified by name
A	410.18-413.27	 Well what we're gonna we'll anonymize it in the transcript
C	413.44-413.82	 Right
A	413.93-415.0	 Um but not in the audio
C	415.6-417.91	 OK So then in terms of people worrying about
A	415.98-416.52	 So
C	418.55-419.87	 uh excising
C	420.11-422.15	 things from the transcript it unlikely
C	422.81-424.53	 Since it it isn't attributed
C	425.13-427.78	 Oh I see but the but the but the
A	426.98-431.71	 Right so if I said Oh hi Jerry how are you we're not gonna go through and cancel out the Jerry
C	428.71-429.12	 Yeah
C	431.63-431.96	 Sure
A	432.67-438.6	 Um so we will go through and in the speaker ID tags there'll be you know one seven one eight
C	437.37-437.79	 Right
C	438.85-439.06	 Right
A	439.09-440.17	 Um but uh
A	441.44-448.57	 um it uh I don't know a good way of doing it on the audio and still have people who are doing discourse research be able to use the data
C	444.46-444.67	 OK
C	448.65-450.99	 Mm hmm No I I wasn't complaining I just wanted to understand
A	450.24-450.44	 Yep
A	451.28-451.49	 Right
C	451.82-452.16	 OK
B	452.37-454.69	 Well we can make up aliases for each of us
A	455.31-459.61	 Yeah I mean whatever you wanna do is fine but we find that We want the meeting to be as natural as possible
C	455.69-456.04	 Right
F	455.85-457.88	 OK
C	459.73-460.26	 OK
A	460.06-461.64	 So we're trying to do real meetings
A	462.05-466.16	 And so we don't wanna have to do aliases and we don't want people to be editing what they say
C	462.05-462.39	 Right
B	464.99-465.27	 Right
C	466.22-466.45	 Right
A	466.65-472.19	 So I think that it better just as a post process to edit out every time you bash Microsoft You know
B	471.18-471.73	 Mm hmm
C	472.42-472.65	 Right
C	474.03-476.27	 Um OK So why don't you tell us briefly
C	476.65-478.51	 your give give your normal schpiel
A	476.73-477.52	 OK So
A	478.76-479.07	 Um
A	479.19-483.93	 So this is The project is called Meeting Recorder and there are lots of different aspects of the project Um
A	484.01-487.16	 So my particular interest is in the PDA of the future
A	487.47-491.1	 This is a mock up of one Yes we do believe the PDA of the future will be made of wood
A	491.64-492.47	 Um
A	492.51-496.53	 The idea is that you'd be able to put a PDA at the table at an impromptu meeting
A	496.92-497.72	 and record it
A	497.72-500.43	 and then be able to do querying and retrieval later on on the meeting
A	500.65-505.44	 So that my particular interest is a portable device to do uh information retrieval on meetings
A	505.79-508.5	 Other people are interested in other aspects of meetings
A	508.97-512.31	 Um So the first step on that in any of these is to collect some data
A	512.93-515.98	 And so what we wanted is a room that instrumented with both
A	516.25-520.2	 the table top microphones and these are very high quality pressure zone mikes
A	520.57-522.07	 as well as the close talking mikes
A	522.62-525.69	 What the close talking mikes gives us is some ground truth
A	526.17-528.07	 gives us um high quality audio
A	528.4-534.39	 um especially for people who aren't interested in the acoustic parts of this corpus So for people who are more interested in language
A	534.68-538.3	 we didn't want to penalize them by having only the far field mikes available
A	538.89-542.77	 And then also um it a very very hard task in terms of speech recognition
A	543.32-543.82	 Um
A	544.15-548.13	 And so uh on the far field mikes we can expect very low recognition results
A	548.46-552.2	 So we wanted the near field mikes to at least isolate the difference between the two
A	552.37-556.68	 So that why we're recording in parallel with the close talking and the far field at the same time
A	557.3-566.62	 And then all these channels are recorded simultaneously and framed synchronously so that you can also do things like um beam forming on all the microphones and do research like that
A	567.25-570.24	 Our intention is to release this data to the public
A	570.71-573.28	 um probably through through a body like the LDC
A	573.75-576.62	 And uh just make it as a generally available corpus
A	577.42-577.99	 Um
A	578.54-582.59	 There other work going on in meeting recording So we're we're working with SRI
A	582.64-583.48	 with UW
A	583.83-584.14	 Um
A	584.14-586.63	 NIST has started an effort which will include video
A	586.73-588.29	 We're not including video obviously
A	589.19-590.19	 And uh
A	590.31-592.82	 and then also um a small amount of assistance from IBM
A	593.32-594.05	 Is also involved
A	595.9-600.86	 Um Oh and the digit strings this is just a more constrained task Um
A	601.27-608.83	 So because the general environment is so challenging we decided to to do at least one set of digit strings
A	609.19-614.27	 to give ourselves something easier And it exactly the same digit strings as in TI digits which is a
A	614.88-618.86	 common connected digits corpus So we'll have some um comparison to be able to be made
C	620.85-621.11	 OK
A	621.51-622.05	 Anything else
C	622.11-622.28	 No
A	623.04-627.21	 OK so when the last person comes in just have them wear a wireless It should be on already
A	627.74-628.18	 Um
A	628.53-637.57	 Either one of those And uh read the digit strings and and fill out the forms So the most important form is the consent form so just be be sure everyone signs that if they consent
B	637.62-641.5	 I'm sure it pretty usual for meetings that people come late so you will have to leave what you set
A	640.19-640.43	 Yeah
A	641.39-641.65	 Right
A	642.23-645.15	 And uh just give me a call which my number up there when your meeting is over
C	643.8-644.04	 Yep
A	646.32-648.27	 And I'm going to leave the mike here but it
A	649.41-652.02	 Uh but I'm not gonna be on so don't have them use this one
A	652.32-653.94	 It'll just be sitting here
A	654.65-655.38	 Thank you
B	657.09-658.25	 Input
B	658.29-658.83	 Yeah There we go
C	659.88-662.36	 By the way Adam we will be using the uh
B	662.52-662.69	 Yep
C	663.22-665.19	 screen as well So you know
C	668.62-670.72	 Wow
C	671.28-671.81	 Organization
C	672.03-676.32	 So you guys who got email about this oh uh Friday or something about what we're up to
E	677.39-677.66	 No
F	677.74-677.96	 No
B	681.63-682.12	 I got it
E	683.95-685.41	 What was the nature of the email
C	685.92-687.8	 Oh this was about
C	687.8-691.68	 um inferring intentions from features in context
C	692.21-696.32	 and the words like go to see or visit or
B	695.71-697.42	 Wel I uh I I
C	697.18-697.59	 You didn't get it
E	698.28-698.96	 I don't think I did
C	700.12-701.6	 I guess these have got better filters
C	701.6-702.64	 Cuz I sent it to everybody
C	703.18-704.38	 You just blew it off OK
E	703.23-703.45	 Ah
B	706.02-707.82	 It really simple though So this is the idea
B	708.48-709.12	 Um
B	710.79-711.77	 We could pursue
B	712.72-713.47	 um
B	714.68-718.77	 if we thought it it worth it but uh I think we we will agree on that
B	719.44-723.94	 um to come up with a with a sort of very very first crude prototype
B	724.25-729.2	 and do some implementation work and do some some research and some modeling So the idea is
B	729.75-731.0	 if you want to go somewhere
B	732.05-734.15	 um and
B	734.32-737.56	 focus on that object down
B	737.56-739.58	 Oh I can actually walk with this This is nice
B	739.58-740.57	 down here
B	740.72-741.62	 That the Powder Tower
B	742.81-743.68	 Now um
B	744.0-746.47	 we found in our uh
B	747.16-749.42	 data and from experiments that
B	750.59-751.79	 there three things you can do
B	753.77-754.21	 Um
B	754.98-755.55	 you can walk
B	756.15-756.66	 this way
B	757.53-759.1	 and come really really close to it
B	759.67-760.27	 And touch it
B	761.72-765.48	 But you cannot enter or do anything else Unless you're interested in rock climbing
B	765.74-769.34	 it won't do you no good standing there It just a dark alley But you can touch it
B	770.11-777.06	 If you want to actually go up or into the tower you have to go this way and then through some buildings and up some stairs and so forth
B	777.86-779.74	 If you actually want to see
B	780.6-781.11	 the tower
B	781.24-786.81	 and that what actually most people want to do is just have a good look of it take a picture for the family
B	787.12-789.85	 you have to go this way and go up here
B	790.42-796.48	 And there you have a really view It exploded the during the Thirty years war Really uh interesting sight
E	797.12-797.36	 Mmm
B	797.46-798.23	 And um
B	798.61-799.89	 these uh
B	800.19-802.68	 these lines are um paths or
B	802.68-803.74	 That er
B	803.74-806.51	 the street network of our geographic information system
B	807.07-807.94	 And you can tell that we
B	808.58-810.48	 deliberately cut out this part
B	810.87-815.04	 Because otherwise we couldn't get our GIS system to take to lead people this way
B	815.49-823.43	 It would always use the closest point to the object and then the tourists would be faced you know in front of a wall but it would do them absolutely no good
B	824.24-826.39	 So
B	826.77-828.64	 what we found interesting is first of all
B	829.42-830.38	 intentions differ
B	831.52-833.99	 Maybe you want to enter a building
B	834.96-837.33	 Maybe you want to see it take a picture of it
B	838.24-843.91	 Or maybe you actually want to come as close as possible to the building For whatever reason that may be
E	843.35-844.38	 What it what it made out of
B	845.57-847.89	 Um red limestone
E	850.18-851.31	 So maybe you would wanna touch it
B	851.93-854.34	 Yeah maybe you would want to touch it Um
B	855.82-857.76	 Okay I This um
B	857.93-860.25	 These intentions we we could
B	860.31-860.93	 if we want to
B	860.93-862.61	 call it the the Vista mode
B	862.97-866.63	 where we just want to eh get the overview or look at it
B	866.68-867.42	 the Enter mode
B	868.06-874.8	 and the well Tango mode I always come up with with silly names So this Tango means literally translated to touch
B	875.64-881.52	 So But sometimes the the Tango mode is really relevant in the in the sense that um
B	882.31-884.4	 if you want to uh
B	886.1-888.51	 If you don't have the intention of entering your building
B	889.48-892.0	 but you know that something is really close to it
B	892.91-895.61	 and you just want to approach it or get to that building
B	895.99-900.35	 Consider for example the Post Office in Chicago a building so large that it has its own zip code
B	901.12-903.4	 So the entrance could be miles away
B	904.12-905.22	 from the closest point
B	906.02-906.61	 So sometimes it
B	907.16-909.54	 makes sense maybe to to distinguish there
B	910.5-911.57	 So um
B	912.93-914.21	 I've looked uh through
B	914.83-916.19	 twenty some
B	916.19-918.09	 Uh I didn't look through all the data
B	918.38-922.27	 um and there there uh a lot more different
B	922.75-926.31	 ways in people uh the ways people phrase how to
B	926.03-926.68	 get
B	926.67-928.53	 if they want to get to a certain place
B	928.87-933.86	 And sometimes here it it a little bit more obvious
B	934.03-935.89	 Um
B	935.89-939.14	 Maybe I should go back a couple of steps and go through the
C	938.17-940.84	 No OK come in sit down If you grab yourself a microphone
D	940.94-941.68	 OK
B	943.39-945.67	 You need to sign some stuff and read some digits
C	944.68-946.29	 Well you can sign afterwards
B	946.37-946.83	 or later
D	946.74-948.51	 OK
E	946.87-948.58	 You have to also have to read some digits
C	948.89-949.44	 Afterwards
D	948.92-951.01	 OK Afterwards is fine
D	956.0-957.48	 OK go ahead
B	959.73-960.59	 They are uncomfortable
D	961.12-961.92	 Small
B	962.6-963.76	 Mm hmm
D	963.36-964.95	 Really small OK I see
D	965.97-966.23	 OK
B	967.48-968.75	 Yep
D	968.69-969.1	 Thank you
B	969.97-971.95	 OK but that was our idea Is
C	970.33-973.09	 And it it it it also has to be switched on Nance
E	973.66-975.43	 No that one already on I thought he said Yeah
B	973.81-974.63	 I I think
C	974.37-975.35	 It on OK good
D	975.27-975.84	 OK It on
B	976.65-983.41	 OK That was the idea Um people when they when they want to go to a building sometimes they just want to look at it
B	983.82-986.89	 Sometimes they want to enter it And sometimes they want to get really close to it
B	988.54-989.58	 That something we found
B	989.9-990.72	 It just a truism
B	991.15-994.31	 And the places where you will lead them for these intentions
B	994.59-1003.21	 are sometimes incredibly different I I gave an example where the point where you end up if you want to look at it is completely different from where if you want to enter it
B	1003.31-1011.14	 So this is sort of how people may uh may phrase those requests to a a a mock up system at least that the way they did it
B	1011.97-1019.29	 And we get tons of of these how do I get to I want to go to but also give me directions to and I would like to see
B	1020.03-1020.9	 And um
B	1021.69-1026.55	 what we can sort of do if we look closer closer at the the data
B	1026.55-1027.77	 That was the wrong one
B	1028.02-1032.44	 um we can look at some factors that may make a difference
B	1032.48-1032.99	 First of all
B	1033.52-1035.7	 very important and um that
B	1035.73-1037.6	 I've completely forgot that when we talked
B	1037.82-1041.17	 This is of course a crucial factor what type of object is it
B	1041.69-1044.91	 So some buildings you just don't want to take pictures of
B	1045.81-1046.66	 Or very rarely
B	1047.27-1048.85	 But you usually want to enter them
B	1050.11-1052.43	 Some objects are more picturesque
B	1052.94-1056.91	 and you more more highly photographed Then of course the
B	1057.35-1061.81	 the actual phrases may give us some idea of what the person wants
B	1062.53-1062.91	 Um
B	1063.51-1065.66	 Sometimes I found in the Uh looking at the data
B	1066.28-1069.89	 in a superficial way I found some sort of modifiers that
B	1069.97-1071.98	 that may also give us a hint um
B	1072.18-1073.6	 I'm trying to get to
B	1074.1-1075.27	 Nuh I need to get to
B	1075.44-1077.52	 Sort of hints to the fact that you're not really
B	1078.12-1081.79	 sightseeing and and just there for pleasure and so forth and so on
B	1082.3-1084.35	 And this leads us straight to the context
B	1085.23-1090.13	 which also should be considered That whatever it is you're doing at the moment may also
B	1090.61-1096.47	 influence the interpretation of of a phrase So this is uh really uh uh uh
B	1097.22-1098.82	 My suggestion is really simple
B	1099.58-1102.08	 We start with um
B	1102.35-1102.65	 Now
B	1103.51-1111.11	 Let me uh say one more thing What we do know is that the parser we use in the system will never differentiate between any of these
B	1111.54-1114.64	 So basically all of these things will result in the same
B	1115.29-1117.18	 XML three structure
B	1118.06-1125.63	 Sort of action go and then an object Yeah and a source So it it it way too crude to
D	1120.63-1121.19	 Mm hmm
B	1126.45-1128.46	 capture those differences in intentions
B	1129.19-1135.78	 So I thought Mmm Maybe for a deep understanding task that a nice sort of playground or first little thing
B	1135.9-1143.71	 Where we can start it and sort of look OK we need we gonna get those three structures The crude undifferentiated parse
B	1144.35-1145.55	 Interpreted input
B	1146.72-1155.29	 We may need additional part of speech or maybe just some information on the verb and modifiers auxiliaries
B	1155.86-1165.62	 We'll see And I will try to to sort of come up with a list of factors that we need to get out of there and maybe we want to get a switch for the context
B	1165.96-1168.5	 So this is not something which we can actually monitor
B	1169.4-1170.51	 now
B	1170.97-1172.46	 but just is something we can set
B	1173.79-1180.88	 And then you can all imagine sort of a a constrained satisfaction program depending on on what um comes out
B	1181.3-1184.38	 We want to have an a structure resulting
B	1184.86-1188.47	 if we feed it through a belief net or or something along those lines
B	1189.04-1195.2	 We'd get an inferred intention we we produce a structure that differentiates between the Vista the Enter and the
B	1196.28-1200.06	 um Tango mode Which I think we maybe want to
B	1200.66-1201.41	 ignore But
B	1202.49-1204.02	 That my idea It up for discussion
B	1204.62-1206.79	 We can change all of it any bit of it
B	1208.69-1209.31	 Throw it all away
F	1211.57-1213.05	 Now this email that you sent actually
C	1213.1-1213.35	 What
F	1213.41-1214.78	 Now I remember the email
C	1214.77-1215.11	 OK
E	1216.17-1218.02	 Huh Still I have no
E	1218.84-1221.4	 recollection whatsoever of the email I'll have to go back and check
C	1221.8-1222.44	 Not important
C	1223.64-1226.82	 So what is important is that we
C	1227.08-1229.57	 understand what the proposed task
C	1230.12-1230.63	 is
C	1231.98-1235.74	 And the the uh Robert and I talked about this some on Friday
C	1238.63-1239.73	 we think it well formed
C	1240.27-1241.74	 So we think it a well formed
C	1242.77-1245.45	 uh starter task for this
C	1245.99-1248.84	 uh deeper understanding in the tourist domain
F	1252.91-1257.8	 So where exactly is the uh deeper understanding being done Like I mean is it before the Bayes net Is it uh
C	1257.76-1260.26	 Well it the it it always all of it
C	1260.49-1263.23	 So in general it always going to be the answer is
C	1263.72-1264.29	 everywhere
C	1264.95-1269.66	 Uh so the notion is that uh this isn't real deep
C	1270.05-1276.99	 But it deep enough that you can distinguish between these three quite different kinds of uh going to see some tourist thing
C	1277.94-1284.51	 And so that that the quote deep that we're trying to get at And Robert point is that
C	1284.98-1287.32	 the current front end
C	1288.27-1291.64	 doesn't give you any way to Not only doesn't it do it
C	1292.32-1299.06	 but it also doesn't give you enough information to do it It isn't like if you just took what the front end gives you
C	1299.47-1304.45	 and used some clever inference algorithm on it you would be able to figure out which of these is going on
C	1305.19-1305.45	 So
C	1306.03-1313.14	 uh and this is Bu in general it gonna be true of any kind of deep understanding there gonna be contextual things there're gonna be linguistic things there're gonna be discourse things
C	1313.95-1315.55	 and they gotta be combined
C	1316.54-1323.77	 And my idea on how to combine them is with a belief net although it may turn out that some totally different thing is gonna work better
C	1324.18-1324.83	 Um
C	1325.26-1326.69	 the idea would be that
C	1327.7-1329.06	 you uh
C	1330.1-1331.39	 take your
C	1334.74-1335.72	 You're editing your slide
B	1335.98-1339.39	 Yeah As sort of as I get ideas uh uh
C	1339.07-1339.39	 Oh
B	1341.97-1345.99	 So discourse I I I thought about that Of course that needs to sort of go in there
C	1345.42-1348.62	 Oh I'm sorry OK So This is minutes taking minutes as we go
B	1349.24-1349.4	 Yep
C	1349.52-1351.31	 in his in his own way
C	1351.35-1353.57	 Um but the the Anyway So the thing is
C	1353.61-1354.95	 uh
C	1355.05-1356.3	 naively speaking
C	1356.38-1357.96	 you've you've got a
C	1358.12-1359.59	 for this little task a belief net
C	1359.88-1362.01	 which is going to have as output
C	1362.39-1365.7	 the conditional probability of one of three things
C	1365.7-1371.39	 that the person wants to uh to View it to Enter it or to Tango with it
C	1373.03-1374.14	 Um
C	1374.84-1376.7	 So that the the output of the belief net is
C	1377.17-1377.95	 pretty well formed
C	1378.75-1381.28	 And then the inputs
C	1381.62-1384.04	 are going to be these kinds of things
C	1385.33-1387.01	 And then the question is
C	1387.01-1389.87	 there are two questions is uh one where do you get this
C	1389.92-1392.34	 information from and two what the structure of the belief net
C	1392.55-1394.49	 So what are the conditional probabilities
C	1395.02-1396.82	 of this that and the other given these things
C	1397.29-1400.88	 And you probably need intermediate nodes I we don't know what they are yet
C	1401.95-1404.85	 So it may well be that uh for example
C	1405.94-1409.05	 that uh knowing whether
C	1409.34-1410.56	 Oh another thing you want
C	1411.39-1413.48	 is some information
C	1414.3-1415.41	 I think
C	1415.56-1417.31	 about the time of day
C	1417.61-1419.49	 Now they may wanna call that part of context
C	1419.84-1421.3	 But the time of day matters a lot
B	1420.1-1420.72	 Mm hmm
C	1422.43-1425.32	 And if things are obviously closed
C	1426.52-1427.22	 then
C	1427.57-1428.25	 you
B	1427.74-1428.7	 People won't want to enter it
C	1428.46-1429.94	 Pe people don't wanna enter them
C	1430.5-1434.46	 And if it not obvious you may want to actually
C	1435.01-1440.84	 uh point out to people that it closed you know what they're going to is closed and they don't have the option of entering it
C	1442.0-1443.26	 So another thing that can come up
C	1443.62-1446.31	 and will come up as soon as you get serious about this is
C	1446.9-1449.84	 that another option of course is to
C	1450.96-1451.95	 have a more of a dialogue
C	1452.76-1454.37	 So if someone says something you could ask them
E	1454.88-1455.14	 Yeah
C	1455.39-1459.39	 OK And Now one thing you could do is always ask them but that boring
C	1460.09-1463.29	 And it also it also be a pain for the person using it
C	1463.62-1467.04	 So one thing you could do is build a little system that said whenever you got a question like that I've got
C	1467.25-1469.88	 one of three answers Ask them which one you want
C	1470.81-1474.49	 OK But that um not what we're gonna do
B	1474.81-1478.31	 But maybe that a false state of the system that it too close to call
C	1478.56-1483.89	 Oh yeah You want the you want the ability to You want the ability to ask but what you don't wanna do is
C	1484.5-1487.13	 build a system that always asks every time and
C	1487.38-1490.52	 That not getting at the scientific problem and it
B	1489.31-1489.8	 Mm hmm
C	1490.58-1491.5	 In general you're you know
C	1492.08-1494.06	 it gonna be much more complex than that
C	1494.6-1497.52	 This is purposely a really simple case
B	1497.43-1498.97	 Yeah
C	1497.86-1500.44	 So uh Yeah
B	1500.18-1508.68	 I have one more point to to Bhaskara question Um I think also the the the deep understanding part of it is is going to be in there to the extent that we
B	1509.34-1511.06	 um want it in terms of
B	1511.61-1514.31	 our modeling We can start you know basic from
B	1514.65-1516.91	 human beings model that its motions
B	1516.91-1525.12	 going walking seeing we can model all of that and then compose whatever inferences we make out of these really conceptual primitives
B	1525.52-1528.83	 That will be extremely deep in the in in in my understanding
C	1527.88-1528.05	 Yeah
C	1528.56-1530.46	 so so the way that might come up
C	1530.86-1532.71	 if you wanna Suppose you wanted to do that you might say
C	1533.01-1538.34	 Um as an intermediate step in your belief net is there a Source Path Goal
C	1538.72-1540.37	 schema involved
C	1540.57-1548.35	 OK And if so uh is there a focus on the goal Or is there a focus on the path or something
C	1548.72-1551.67	 And that could be uh
C	1552.08-1555.96	 one of the you know the
C	1556.21-1559.51	 In some piece of the belief net that could be the the appropriate thing to enter
F	1560.14-1562.68	 So where would we extract that information from From the three
C	1563.31-1563.97	 No
C	1564.41-1566.57	 No See the three is not gonna give What he was saying is
C	1566.94-1571.3	 the three does not have any of that All it has is some really crude stuff saying
F	1569.19-1569.48	 Right
C	1572.25-1574.12	 A person wants to go to a place
E	1573.85-1575.94	 The three is the old output
C	1576.19-1576.4	 Right
E	1576.46-1576.65	 OK
C	1576.88-1580.27	 well three itself refers to Multimedia Mark up Language
E	1578.6-1580.09	 It just a language Right yeah
C	1580.45-1581.29	 So we have we
C	1581.65-1586.66	 we have to have a better way of referring to
B	1586.51-1587.57	 The parser output
C	1586.75-1586.91	 Mm hmm
C	1587.56-1588.19	 Yeah The
B	1587.57-1591.96	 Analyzed speech I think it what they call it really oder
C	1589.38-1590.1	 Well OK
C	1592.0-1592.58	 Yeah
B	1592.7-1595.52	 No actually intention lattices is what we're gonna get
C	1595.08-1598.55	 Is but they they call it intention lattice but Anyway
B	1597.25-1601.05	 In intention lattice Hypothesis They call it intention hypotheses
C	1601.28-1601.48	 Right
C	1601.99-1609.17	 So they're gonna give us some uh or We can assume that you get this crude information
C	1610.41-1613.57	 About intention and that all they're going to provide
C	1614.72-1617.64	 And they don't give you the kind of object they don't give you
C	1618.02-1621.55	 any discourse history if you want to keep that you have to keep it somewhere else
B	1624.18-1625.82	 Well they keep it We have to request it
C	1626.67-1626.9	 Right
B	1627.21-1627.39	 Nuh
B	1627.63-1628.54	 But it not in there
C	1627.76-1631.17	 Well they they they keep it by their lights It may it may or may not
B	1630.11-1631.19	 Hmm
B	1631.95-1632.37	 Yeah or
C	1632.46-1634.49	 be what what we want Yeah
E	1634.66-1637.81	 So if someone says I wanna touch the side of the Powder Tower
E	1639.74-1641.14	 that would
E	1641.14-1645.02	 basically we need to pop up Tango mode and the
E	1645.11-1645.88	 and the directions
C	1645.39-1648.55	 If if Yeah if it got as simple as that yeah But it wouldn't
E	1647.55-1647.89	 Yeah
E	1648.71-1649.0	 OK
E	1651.14-1652.89	 But that doesn't necessarily
E	1653.62-1656.7	 But we'd have to infer a Source Path Goal to some degree for
E	1657.66-1659.1	 touching the side right
B	1659.25-1660.32	 Well
B	1659.64-1664.41	 Uh there is a a point there if I understand you Correct
B	1664.49-1665.79	 Um
B	1666.7-1668.12	 because um
B	1668.82-1671.12	 sometimes people just say
B	1671.67-1675.79	 things This you find very often Where is the city hall
B	1676.67-1677.15	 And this
B	1677.53-1684.09	 they don't wanna see it on a map or they don't wanna know it five hundred yards away from you or that it to the your north They wanna go there
B	1684.88-1687.07	 That what they say is Where is it
B	1687.29-1688.12	 Where is that damn thing
E	1688.34-1690.0	 And the parser would output
B	1691.06-1692.06	 Well that
B	1692.39-1693.56	 a a question mark
B	1693.74-1695.75	 A lot of parsers um
B	1696.89-1698.11	 just uh
B	1698.74-1701.99	 That way beyond their scope is of interpreting that You know
B	1702.49-1703.12	 But um
B	1703.47-1707.8	 still outcome the outcome will be some form of structure
B	1708.21-1714.54	 with the town hall and maybe saying it a WH focus on the town hall But to interpret it
D	1714.89-1716.07	 Mm hmm
B	1715.55-1718.21	 you know somebody else has to do that job later
E	1718.04-1720.3	 I'm just trying to figure out what the system would output
C	1718.14-1718.54	 Yeah
E	1720.94-1722.21	 depending on these things
B	1723.2-1730.78	 Um it will probably tell you how far away it is at least that That even what Deep Map does It tells you how far away it is and and shows it to you on a map
B	1733.5-1740.92	 Because we can not differentiate at the moment between you know the intention of wanting to go there or the intention of just wanting to know where where it is
D	1742.86-1746.08	 People might not be able to infer that either right Like the fact
D	1746.25-1749.17	 Like I could imagine if someone came up to me and asked Where the city hall
D	1749.17-1751.21	 I might say Are you trying to get there
D	1751.22-1752.4	 Because how I describe
D	1753.75-1759.07	 um its location uh probably depend on whether I think I should give them you know directions now or
B	1754.8-1755.16	 Mm hmm
D	1759.66-1761.77	 say you know whatever It half a mile away or something like that
B	1761.53-1766.82	 It a granularity factor because where people ask you Where is New York you will tell them it on the East Coast
C	1761.66-1761.88	 Yeah
D	1763.48-1764.79	 Uh huh Yeah Exactly
D	1765.53-1765.79	 Right
D	1766.82-1767.09	 Right
B	1766.82-1770.9	 eh you won't tell them how to get there you know take that bus to the airport and blah blah blah
D	1768.82-1769.02	 Yeah
D	1771.03-1771.31	 Right
B	1771.4-1774.42	 But if it the post office you will tell them how to get there
D	1774.37-1774.63	 Mm hmm
B	1775.29-1775.88	 So
B	1776.51-1779.24	 They have done some interesting experiments on that in Hamburg as well So
D	1777.56-1778.76	 Right Right
C	1780.64-1781.61	 But
C	1783.5-1785.36	 Go go back to the the uh
C	1785.44-1786.09	 Yeah that slide
B	1785.93-1789.85	 So I this is onto is is knowledge about buildings their opening times
B	1790.36-1792.42	 and then coupled with time of day
B	1793.07-1793.6	 um
B	1794.69-1795.41	 this should
B	1795.41-1796.3	 You know
D	1795.85-1801.79	 So that context was like um their presumed purpose context like business or travel
D	1801.98-1806.28	 as well as the utterance context like I'm now standing at this place at this time
C	1805.55-1806.6	 Yeah well I think we ought to
C	1806.76-1808.11	 As we have all along
C	1808.11-1809.07	 We we've been
C	1809.49-1813.66	 distinguishing between situational context which is what you have as context
C	1813.92-1817.13	 and discourse context which you have as DH I don't know what the means
B	1814.91-1816.29	 Mm hmm
B	1816.4-1816.63	 Nuh
B	1817.35-1817.83	 History
B	1818.43-1819.35	 Discourse history
C	1819.1-1819.44	 OK
C	1819.44-1819.79	 Whatever
B	1819.5-1819.81	 Yeah
C	1820.25-1822.08	 So we can work out terminology later
B	1821.91-1822.12	 Yep
C	1822.4-1824.0	 So they're they're quite distinct
C	1825.2-1826.92	 I mean you need them both but they're quite distinct
C	1827.51-1831.3	 And so what we were talking about doing as a first shot
C	1832.05-1835.87	 is not doing any of the linguistics
C	1838.17-1842.31	 Except to find out what seems to be useful
C	1842.91-1845.98	 So the the the reason the belief net is in blue
C	1846.34-1848.1	 is the notion would be
C	1848.15-1851.63	 Uh this may be a bad bad idea but the idea is
C	1851.85-1853.16	 to take as a first goal
C	1853.52-1855.98	 see if we could actually build a belief net
C	1856.7-1859.11	 that would make this three way distinction
C	1859.83-1861.88	 uh in a plausible way given
C	1862.33-1867.05	 these We have all these transcripts and we're able to
C	1868.09-1877.93	 by hand extract the features to put in the belief net Saying Aha here're the things which if you get them out of out of the language and discourse and put them into the belief net it would tell you
C	1878.37-1882.29	 which of these three uh intentions is most likely
C	1883.13-1890.49	 And if to actually do that build it um you know run it run it on the data where you hand transcribe
C	1891.5-1892.38	 the parameters
C	1892.92-1894.05	 And see how that goes
C	1894.63-1896.3	 If that goes well
C	1897.19-1899.88	 then we can start worrying about how we would
C	1900.19-1900.85	 extract them
C	1901.24-1903.0	 So where would you get this information
C	1903.62-1906.98	 And expand it to to other things like this
C	1907.8-1909.12	 But if we can't do that
C	1911.02-1912.14	 then we're in trouble
C	1912.76-1915.19	 I mean if you can't do this task
C	1915.97-1917.67	 um
B	1918.15-1920.59	 We need a different uh engine Machine I mean
C	1919.56-1925.95	 Uh uh yeah or something Well it if it if it the belief nets we'll switch to you know logic or some terrible thing but
C	1926.28-1928.07	 I don't think that gonna be the case I think that
C	1928.69-1931.07	 uh if we can get the information
C	1931.98-1934.43	 a belief net is a perfectly good way of
C	1934.95-1935.68	 doing the
C	1936.19-1937.42	 inferential combination of it
C	1939.4-1943.83	 The real issue is what are the factors involved in determining this
C	1946.25-1946.78	 And I don't know
B	1948.81-1949.59	 Hmm
B	1951.23-1952.99	 But only
C	1952.36-1953.21	 Hold on a Hold on a second
B	1953.57-1954.09	 Muh
C	1953.84-1956.89	 So I know Uh uh is it clear what going on here
F	1960.54-1960.69	 Yep
D	1965.5-1967.17	 Um I missed the beginning but um
D	1967.69-1972.93	 I guess could you back to the slide the previous one So is it that it um
D	1974.89-1976.89	 These are all factors that uh
D	1977.4-1980.65	 These are the ones that you said that we are going to ignore now or that we want to
D	1981.48-1982.84	 take into account You were saying
C	1983.48-1984.21	 Take them into account
D	1984.2-1985.57	 Take the the linguistic factors too
C	1984.49-1986.41	 But but you don't worry about
D	1985.94-1987.68	 Oh how to extract these features OK
C	1986.86-1987.65	 how to extract them
C	1987.85-1989.78	 So let find out which ones we need first
D	1988.6-1988.91	 Got it
D	1991.16-1991.51	 OK
D	1991.51-1996.02	 And and it clear from the data um like sorta the correct answer in each case
C	1991.54-1991.86	 and
C	1996.29-1996.56	 No
D	1996.4-1996.83	 But
B	1997.5-1998.21	 No But
D	1997.54-1999.14	 OK That that the thing I'm curious
C	1998.16-1998.72	 Let go back to
C	1998.72-2000.58	 Let go back to the the the slide of data
D	2001.86-2004.2	 Like do we know from the data which
B	2001.9-2002.25	 Um
D	2004.2-2005.3	 OK So
B	2005.23-2006.29	 Not from that data
B	2006.87-2008.69	 But um since we are designing
D	2008.8-2010.04	 Mm hmm
B	2008.97-2013.83	 a a a an compared to this even bigger data collection effort
D	2012.61-2013.3	 Mm hmm
B	2013.87-2015.93	 um we will definitely take care to put it in there
D	2016.11-2016.49	 Mm hmm
B	2016.33-2016.67	 in some
C	2017.52-2018.04	 Yeah
B	2017.68-2018.99	 shape way form over the other
B	2019.22-2019.87	 to see whether
D	2019.33-2019.66	 Right
B	2020.38-2021.22	 we can then get
B	2021.83-2023.48	 sort of empirically validated data
B	2023.98-2030.09	 Um from this we can sometimes you know and that that but that isn't that what we need for a belief net anyhow is sort of
B	2030.46-2034.14	 sometimes when people want to just see it they phrase it more like this
D	2034.21-2034.53	 Mm hmm
B	2034.28-2038.27	 But it doesn't exclude anybody from phrasing it totally differently even if they still you know
D	2036.9-2037.17	 Right
D	2037.82-2038.09	 Right
B	2038.76-2041.9	 But then other factors may come into play that change the outcome of their belief net
D	2042.36-2042.55	 Right
B	2042.74-2054.14	 So um this is exactly what Because you can never be sure And I'm sure even the most sort of deliberate data collection experiment will never give you data that say Well if it phrased like that
D	2047.44-2047.72	 Sure
B	2054.82-2057.53	 the intention is this You know because then uh you
D	2056.26-2061.22	 I mean the only way you could get that is if you were to give the subjects a task
D	2061.22-2062.44	 Right Where you have where your uh current
D	2063.11-2064.3	 goal is to
B	2063.24-2063.83	 We
B	2064.24-2070.32	 Yeah That what we're doing But but we will still get the phrasing all over the place I'm sure that you know
D	2065.05-2066.11	 So that what you want OK
D	2066.07-2066.86	 So you will know
D	2068.39-2068.75	 Mm hmm
C	2068.85-2069.15	 Yeah
D	2071.11-2074.36	 The No that fine I guess it just knowing the intention from
C	2072.78-2073.09	 Yeah
B	2074.0-2074.53	 Mm hmm
C	2074.75-2075.93	 From that task yeah So
D	2074.85-2076.88	 the experimental subject
C	2076.17-2080.29	 uh I think you all know this but we are going to actually use this little room
C	2080.87-2083.11	 and start recording subjects
C	2083.47-2085.09	 probably within a month or something So
C	2085.48-2086.03	 this is not
C	2086.37-2089.5	 any any of you guys worry except that
C	2090.52-2094.68	 we may want to push that effort to get information we need
C	2094.88-2096.17	 So our job
C	2096.32-2098.62	 is to figure out how to solve these problems
C	2099.17-2102.74	 If it turns out that we need data of a certain sort then
C	2103.16-2104.83	 the sort of data collection branch
C	2105.14-2107.76	 can be uh asked to do that
C	2108.62-2112.52	 And one of the reasons why we're recording the meeting for these guys is cuz we want their help
C	2113.22-2117.49	 when we we start doing uh recording of subjects
C	2119.69-2121.98	 So yeah you're absolutely right though No you you will not have
C	2122.31-2125.19	 and there it is and uh
C	2125.99-2127.12	 But you know
C	2126.93-2128.34	 the um
D	2134.86-2138.45	 And I think the other concern that has come up before too is if it
D	2138.68-2139.35	 um
D	2139.35-2140.94	 I don't know if this was collected
D	2141.13-2145.88	 what situation this data was collected in Was it is it the one that you showed in your talk Like people
B	2145.92-2146.59	 No no No
D	2146.24-2150.48	 But OK So was this like someone actually mobile like
D	2151.06-2152.6	 using a device
B	2153.2-2153.64	 Uh
B	2154.31-2160.41	 no not it was mobile but not not with a a real wizard system So there were never answers
D	2159.57-2160.04	 Uh huh
D	2160.79-2163.1	 OK OK But is it
D	2163.14-2169.34	 I guess I don't know The situation of of collecting the data of like Here you could imagine them being walking around the city
D	2169.72-2172.05	 as like one situation And then you have all sorts of other
D	2172.46-2174.75	 situational context factors that would influence
D	2175.25-2177.59	 how to interpret like you said the scope and things like that
B	2176.24-2176.86	 Mm hmm
D	2178.23-2181.7	 If they're doing it in a you know I'm sitting here with a map and asking questions
D	2181.94-2183.94	 I I would imagine that the data would be really different
D	2184.35-2186.09	 Um so it just
B	2186.94-2188.41	 Yeah
B	2188.41-2188.67	 But
B	2188.93-2196.44	 It was never the goal of that data collection to to serve for for such a purpose So that why for example the tasks were not
D	2195.01-2195.49	 Mm hmm
B	2196.8-2203.69	 differentiated by intentionality there was there was no label you know intention intention intention Or task
D	2199.61-2200.19	 Mm hmm Right
B	2204.18-2206.27	 Um
B	2206.23-2210.01	 I'm sure we can produce some if we need it um that
D	2208.61-2209.28	 Mm hmm
B	2209.99-2211.65	 that will help us along those lines But
B	2212.08-2214.75	 you know you gotta leave something for other people to model
B	2214.95-2216.43	 So to Finding out what you know
D	2215.81-2216.51	 Mm hmm
B	2218.22-2223.15	 situational what the contextual factors of the situation really are you know is an interesting
B	2223.62-2224.28	 interesting thing
D	2224.74-2225.3	 Mm hmm
B	2226.24-2235.18	 Sort of I'm at the moment curious and I'm I'm want to approach it from the end where we can sort of start with this toy system that we can play around with
D	2234.58-2234.91	 Mm hmm
B	2235.74-2238.44	 so that we get a clearer notion of what input we need
D	2238.59-2238.98	 Mm hmm
B	2239.09-2240.0	 for that
B	2240.0-2241.76	 what suffices and what doesn't
B	2241.76-2245.58	 And then we can start worrying about where to get this input what
B	2246.14-2247.61	 what do we need you know
B	2247.65-2258.13	 Ultimately once we are all experts in changing that parser for example maybe there just a couple three things we need to do and then we get more whatever part of speech and more construction type like
D	2254.14-2254.66	 Mm hmm
D	2258.05-2258.86	 Hmm
B	2259.37-2259.9	 stuff out of it
B	2262.2-2264.82	 It a pragmatic approach uh at the moment
E	2266.55-2269.02	 How exactly does the data collection work Do they have a map
E	2269.02-2271.35	 and then you give them a scenario of some sort
B	2272.62-2272.91	 OK
B	2274.11-2279.05	 Imagine you're the the subject You're gonna be in here and somebody And and you see uh
B	2279.8-2281.31	 either the three model
B	2281.95-2287.1	 or uh a animation of standing in a square in Heidelberg
B	2287.55-2288.59	 So you actually see that
B	2289.43-2289.95	 Um
B	2290.71-2291.39	 The uh
B	2291.77-2295.38	 um first thing is you have to read a text about Heidelberg
B	2295.51-2303.6	 So just off a textbook uh tourist guide to familiarize uh yourself with that sort of odd sounding German street names like Fischergasse and so forth
B	2304.31-2306.73	 So that part one Part two is you're told
B	2308.0-2312.98	 that this huge new wonderful computer system exists that can tell you everything you want to know
B	2313.82-2315.09	 and it understands you completely
B	2315.76-2320.0	 And so you're gonna pick up that phone dial a number and you get a certain amount of tasks that you have to solve
B	2320.48-2323.35	 First you have to know find out how to get to that place
B	2323.54-2326.45	 maybe with the intention of buying stamps in there
B	2326.96-2331.08	 Maybe So the next task is to get to a certain place and take a picture for your grandchild
B	2331.99-2333.21	 The third one is to
B	2333.73-2335.79	 get information on the history of an object
B	2336.11-2337.42	 The fourth one
B	2337.45-2339.09	 And then the system breaks down
B	2340.37-2340.89	 It crashes
D	2341.56-2342.98	 At the third Right then
B	2341.89-2342.33	 And
B	2343.16-2344.64	 After the third task
D	2343.5-2343.89	 OK
B	2344.88-2345.74	 And then
B	2346.08-2348.34	 Or after the fourth Some find Forget that for now
B	2348.69-2350.46	 And then a human operator comes on
B	2350.75-2356.36	 and and apologizes that the system has crashed but you know urges you to continue you know
B	2356.64-2357.81	 now with a human operator
B	2358.25-2362.48	 And so you have basically the same tasks again just with different objects
B	2363.19-2364.54	 and you go through it again and that was it
B	2366.04-2368.42	 Oh and one one little bit
B	2368.64-2374.33	 And uh the computer you are you are being told the computer system knows exactly where you are via GPS
B	2374.82-2377.69	 When the human operator comes on um
B	2378.08-2381.18	 that person does not know So the GPS is crashed as well
B	2381.37-2384.07	 So the person first has to ask you Where are you
B	2384.5-2385.89	 And so you have to do some
B	2385.9-2389.27	 tell the person sort of where you are depending on what you see there
B	2389.96-2394.67	 Um this is a a a a a bit that I I don't think we Did we discuss that bit
B	2395.17-2396.96	 Uh I just sort of squeezed that in now
B	2397.32-2401.15	 But it something uh that would provide some very interesting data for some people I know
B	2402.33-2402.68	 So
D	2403.63-2407.08	 So in the display you can
D	2407.2-2410.25	 Oh you said that you you might have a display that shows like the
B	2409.54-2412.87	 Yeah Additionally you have a a a sort of a map type display
D	2411.85-2415.03	 a your perspective sort of And so as you
B	2413.96-2414.65	 Uh two
D	2415.25-2419.22	 Oh two OK So as you move through it that they just track it on the
B	2416.27-2416.59	 Two
B	2419.26-2419.86	 Yeah
D	2419.54-2420.28	 for themselves
B	2420.52-2421.56	 You don't
D	2420.69-2421.92	 there
B	2421.56-2422.24	 That
B	2422.48-2424.8	 I don't know I but I don't think you really move
D	2425.24-2426.06	 OK So
B	2425.53-2426.56	 sort of Yeah
B	2426.7-2429.56	 I mean that would be an an an enormous technical effort
B	2430.3-2431.26	 unless we
B	2431.41-2432.65	 would
B	2432.68-2439.44	 We can show it walks to you know We can have movies of walking you walking through through Heidelberg and ultimately arriving there
D	2436.88-2437.23	 Mm hmm
B	2439.87-2441.07	 Maybe we wanna do that Yeah
D	2442.01-2445.56	 Uh I was just trying to figure out how how ambitious the system is
B	2444.0-2446.33	 The map was sort of intended to
B	2446.33-2452.11	 You want to go to that place You know and it sort of there And you see the label of the name
D	2448.4-2449.72	 Mm hmm
B	2452.11-2455.72	 So we get those names pronunciation stuff and so forth and we can change that
D	2454.43-2455.07	 Mm hmm
D	2456.61-2456.84	 Mm hmm
D	2457.07-2460.23	 So your tasks don't require you to
D	2461.05-2464.86	 I mean uh you're told So when your task is I don't know Go buy stamps or something like that
D	2464.99-2467.92	 So do you have to respond or does your
D	2468.09-2471.3	 Uh what are you what are you supposed to be telling the system Like
D	2472.33-2474.62	 what you're doing now or
B	2475.32-2476.45	 Well we'll see what people do
D	2476.37-2478.96	 There no OK so it just like Let figure out what they would say
B	2479.81-2483.64	 Yeah and and we will record both sides I mean we will record the Wi the Wizard
D	2479.89-2480.79	 under the circumstances
D	2482.86-2484.02	 Uh huh Uh huh
B	2483.89-2485.86	 I mean in both cases it gonna be a human in the
B	2486.11-2487.71	 computer and in the operator case
B	2488.32-2491.24	 And we will there will be some dialogue you know
B	2491.32-2493.61	 So you first have to do this and that and and
D	2492.29-2492.44	 Yep
D	2494.27-2495.15	 Mm hmm
B	2494.8-2501.62	 see what they say We can instruct the uh wizard in how expressive and talkative he should be
B	2501.81-2502.59	 But um
B	2503.53-2511.56	 maybe the maybe what you're suggesting Is what you're suggesting that it might be too poor the data if we sort of limit it to this ping pong one
B	2511.86-2518.02	 uh task results in a question and then there an answer and that the end of the task You wanna have it more more steps sort of
D	2518.19-2520.95	 Yeah I I don't know how much direction is given to the subject
D	2520.95-2521.61	 about what
D	2521.96-2527.98	 their interaction I mean they're unfamiliar with interacting with the system All they know is it this great system that could do
B	2526.38-2526.67	 Mm hmm
D	2528.19-2530.34	 stuff Right So
B	2528.37-2528.74	 Mm hmm
C	2529.17-2532.11	 Oh yeah but to some extent this is a different discussion
C	2532.94-2533.45	 OK So
C	2533.91-2538.19	 Uh we we have to have this discussion of the experiment and the data collection and all that sorta stuff
D	2535.56-2535.8	 Uh huh
C	2538.79-2543.65	 and we do have um a student who
C	2544.19-2545.61	 is a candidate for wizard
C	2546.42-2549.66	 Uh she gonna get in touch with me It a student of Eve
C	2551.03-2554.09	 FEY Fey Spelled FEY Do you do you
D	2553.39-2555.54	 Oh Fey Parrill Yeah Uh huh
C	2554.74-2555.06	 You know her
C	2556.47-2559.58	 OK Sh Is
D	2557.91-2563.06	 She started taking the class last year and then didn't um you know didn't continue I She a
D	2563.74-2565.32	 Is she an She is a graduate OK
C	2563.78-2564.48	 She graduated
C	2565.43-2565.61	 Yeah
D	2566.2-2570.04	 Yeah I I know her very very briefly I know she was you know interested in
C	2571.35-2571.56	 OK
D	2571.36-2572.73	 aspect and stuff like that
C	2571.86-2576.91	 So anyway she looking for some more part time work while she waiting actually for graduate school
C	2577.24-2578.78	 And she'll be in touch So we may have
C	2579.39-2580.33	 someone
C	2580.78-2585.01	 uh to do this and she got you know some background in in
C	2585.33-2588.25	 all this stuff And is a linguist and so So
C	2588.85-2594.36	 That So Nancy we'll have At some point we'll have another discussion on
D	2592.3-2592.86	 Mm hmm
C	2595.02-2597.65	 exactly you know how that gonna go
C	2598.32-2599.8	 And um
C	2600.3-2603.7	 Jane but also uh Liz
D	2604.27-2604.73	 Mm hmm
C	2604.44-2606.22	 have offered to help us do this
D	2605.94-2606.79	 Mmm
C	2606.94-2608.77	 uh data collection and design and stuff
C	2609.68-2613.12	 So when we get to that we'll have some people doing it that know what they're doing
D	2609.99-2610.29	 OK
D	2614.43-2618.31	 I guess the reason I was asking about the sort of the the details of this kind of thing is that um
D	2619.17-2625.13	 it one thing to collect data for I don't know speech recognition or various other tasks that have pretty clear
D	2625.27-2627.47	 correct answers but with intention
D	2627.47-2630.98	 um obviously as you point out there a lot of other factors and
D	2630.72-2632.99	 I'm not really sure um
D	2633.37-2636.85	 how how the question of how to make it a appropriate toy
D	2637.11-2638.11	 version of that
D	2638.51-2641.57	 Um it it just hard So I mean obviously it a
E	2640.24-2644.52	 Yeah uh actually I guess that was my question Is the intention implicit in the scenario that given
E	2645.34-2645.64	 Like
E	2646.73-2648.27	 do the
D	2647.58-2650.7	 It is if they have these tasks that they're supposed to
E	2649.91-2652.86	 Yeah I just wasn't sure to what level of detail the task was
D	2651.41-2653.67	 to to give Yeah uh
B	2653.47-2655.36	 Mm hmm No one is at the moment
D	2653.77-2654.01	 Right
D	2655.51-2655.76	 Right
E	2655.78-2656.08	 OK
C	2656.44-2658.0	 So that part of what we'll have to figure out
D	2657.49-2657.75	 Right
D	2659.67-2660.6	 Mm hmm
C	2659.96-2661.33	 But uh
C	2661.77-2662.74	 the
C	2664.34-2667.28	 The problem that I was gonna try to focus on today was
C	2667.59-2673.1	 let suppose by magic you could collect dialogues in which one way or the other
C	2673.51-2679.09	 you were able to uh figure out both the intention and set the context and
C	2679.3-2683.0	 know what language was used So let suppose that we can get that kind of data
C	2684.35-2685.47	 Um
C	2685.97-2687.8	 The issue is can we
C	2688.37-2693.9	 find a way to basically featurize it so that we get some discrete number of features so that
C	2694.23-2701.17	 uh when we know the values to all those features or as many as possible we can come up with the best estimate of which of the
C	2701.72-2703.51	 in this case three little intentions
C	2705.7-2706.28	 most likely
D	2709.79-2713.42	 What are the three intentions Is it to go there to see it and
B	2713.46-2714.9	 To come as close as possible to it
C	2714.14-2716.97	 Th the terminology we're using is to
D	2715.49-2715.7	 Yeah it
C	2716.97-2717.79	 Go back
C	2718.5-2718.68	 To
D	2718.52-2718.84	 OK
C	2719.2-2719.62	 to View it
C	2721.0-2721.82	 OK To Enter it
C	2723.09-2726.78	 Now those It seems to me those are you you have no trouble with those being distinct
C	2726.78-2727.58	 Take a picture of it
D	2727.7-2728.23	 Mm hmm
C	2728.1-2731.25	 you you might well want to be a really rather different place than
D	2730.78-2731.03	 Mm hmm
C	2731.68-2732.21	 entering it
C	2732.83-2734.82	 And for an object that at all big
D	2732.85-2733.62	 Mm hmm
C	2735.21-2737.51	 uh sort of getting to the nearest part of it
D	2738.13-2738.59	 Mm hmm
C	2738.36-2740.6	 uh could be quite different than either of those
D	2740.52-2740.93	 Mm hmm
C	2741.45-2742.5	 Just sort of
D	2742.79-2745.35	 OK so now I understand the referent of Tango mode
E	2745.75-2747.38	 See I would have thought it was more of a waltz
D	2745.95-2747.64	 I didn't get that before
B	2749.18-2749.8	 To Waltz it
D	2750.32-2755.35	 Yeah like how close are you gonna be Like Tango really close
C	2752.41-2752.52	 Well
E	2752.42-2755.56	 Yeah cuz a tango Yeah
C	2755.35-2757.04	 Well anyway So
F	2756.16-2757.13	 All these
F	2757.09-2758.96	 So like the question is how what features can
F	2759.11-2761.97	 like do you wanna try to extract from say the parse or whatever
F	2761.95-2765.75	 Like the presence of a word or the presence of a certain uh stem or
C	2761.95-2762.2	 Right
C	2765.72-2766.1	 Right
F	2766.62-2767.89	 certain construction or whatever
C	2767.7-2770.34	 Is there a construction or the kind of object or
C	2771.34-2777.52	 uh anything else that in the It either in the in the the discourse itself or in the context
C	2778.09-2783.89	 So if it turns out that whatever it is you want to know whether the person uh a tourist or not
C	2784.36-2785.81	 OK that becomes a feature
C	2785.85-2787.16	 Now how you determine that
C	2787.74-2790.22	 is another issue But for the current problem
C	2790.64-2795.54	 it would just be OK if you can be sure that it a tourist versus a businessman versus a native
C	2795.93-2796.63	 or something
C	2797.08-2798.37	 uh that would give you
C	2798.77-2803.5	 a lot of discriminatory power and then just have a little section in your belief net that said pppt
C	2803.54-2805.16	 Though in the short run you'd set them
F	2805.81-2806.41	 Mm hmm
C	2806.58-2809.26	 and see how it worked and then in the longer run
C	2809.81-2812.49	 you would figure out how you could derive them
F	2815.3-2815.62	 Right
C	2815.61-2818.03	 From previous discourse or anything else you knew
F	2829.57-2834.18	 So how should What the uh plan Like how should we go about figuring out these
C	2832.91-2837.2	 OK So first of all is uh do either of you guys
C	2837.41-2842.02	 you got a favorite belief net that you've you know played with or something
F	2842.4-2842.61	 Oh
F	2844.24-2844.82	 No not really
C	2845.52-2847.13	 OK Well anyway Get one
C	2847.82-2850.48	 OK So so one of one of the things we wanna do is actually
C	2851.13-2852.77	 uh pick a package
C	2853.23-2854.13	 doesn't matter which one
C	2854.77-2858.7	 uh presumably one that got good interactive abilities cuz a lot of what we're gonna be
C	2859.05-2861.35	 You know we don't need the one that'll solve massive
C	2861.98-2863.89	 uh belief nets quickly
C	2863.96-2866.87	 These are not gonna get big in in the foreseeable future
C	2867.25-2868.45	 But we do want one
C	2868.92-2872.9	 in which it easy to interact with and uh modify
C	2874.08-2876.58	 Because that A lot of what it gonna be is
C	2877.14-2878.01	 um
C	2879.4-2883.22	 playing with this And probably one in which it easy to have
C	2883.94-2890.05	 um what amounts to transcript files So that if if we have all these cases
C	2890.47-2892.89	 OK So we make up cases that have these features
C	2893.33-2896.61	 OK and then you'd like to be able to say OK here a bunch of cases
C	2896.84-2899.4	 There're even ones that you can do learning
C	2900.1-2907.37	 OK So you have all their cases and and their results and you have a algorithms to go through and run around trying to set the the probabilities for you
C	2908.23-2909.57	 Um
C	2910.25-2911.64	 probably that not worth it
C	2912.41-2915.05	 I mean my guess is we aren't gonna have enough data that good enough to make
C	2915.76-2918.37	 the these data fitting ones
C	2918.86-2919.62	 worth it but I don't know
C	2920.26-2925.88	 So I would say you the first task for you two guys is to um pick a package
C	2926.6-2931.11	 OK and you wanna it You know the standard things you want it stable you want it yeah
C	2931.36-2934.39	 And as soon as we have one we can start
B	2933.76-2934.66	 An Nuh
C	2935.15-2936.59	 trying to
C	2937.06-2937.89	 uh
C	2938.95-2939.87	 make a first cut
C	2941.48-2942.45	 at what going on
C	2942.84-2944.38	 But it what I like about it is it very concrete
C	2944.68-2951.08	 OK We we have a we know what the outcomes are gonna be and we have some some data that loose we can use our own intuition
C	2952.05-2954.15	 and see how hard it is
C	2954.66-2957.86	 and importantly what intermediate nodes we think we need
C	2958.41-2963.5	 So it if it turns out that just thinking about the problem you come up with things you really need to
C	2963.53-2967.77	 You know this is the kind of thing that is you know an intermediate little piece in your belief net
C	2968.51-2969.57	 That'd be really interesting
E	2969.65-2970.02	 Mm hmm
B	2972.93-2975.15	 And it and it may serve as a platform for
B	2976.19-2981.58	 a person maybe me or whoever who is interested in doing some linguistic analysis
B	2981.58-2988.58	 I mean we have the For group here and we can see what they have found out about those concepts already
B	2989.21-2990.91	 that are contained in the data
B	2991.65-2992.11	 um
B	2992.91-2995.63	 you know to come up with a nice little set of features and um
B	2996.06-2998.49	 maybe even means of uh extracting them
B	2999.1-3005.05	 And and that altogether could also be uh become a nice paper that going to be published somewhere if we sit down and write it
B	3005.87-3007.35	 And um
B	3007.77-3013.96	 When you said belief net you were talking about ones that run on coffee or that are in the program language Java
C	3013.13-3016.49	 No It turns out that there is a
C	3016.25-3017.32	 uh
C	3017.7-3021.8	 The new end of Java libraries OK and it turns out one called Which is
B	3021.4-3021.88	 Mmm OK
C	3022.2-3024.56	 one that fair people around here use a fair amount
C	3024.78-3026.6	 I have no idea whether that
C	3027.48-3031.17	 The obvious advantage of that is that you can then
C	3031.7-3038.96	 relatively easily get all the other Java packages for or whatever else you might want to do So that that I think why
B	3035.68-3036.11	 Mm hmm
C	3039.21-3041.45	 a lot of people doing research use that
C	3042.34-3045.89	 But it may not be I have no idea whether that the best choice and
C	3046.36-3054.27	 there're plenty of people around students in the department who you know live and breathe Bayes nets So uh
D	3054.73-3055.37	 There the
D	3055.84-3057.92	 tool kit that um Kevin Murphy has developed
C	3057.46-3057.67	 Right
C	3058.37-3058.78	 It OK
D	3058.4-3061.78	 which might be useful too And it available Matlab code
F	3059.05-3059.32	 Right
C	3059.89-3063.01	 So yeah Kevin would be a good person to start with
C	3063.08-3067.08	 Nancy knows him well I don't know I don't know whether you guys have met Kevin yet or not but uh
B	3065.75-3067.4	 Mm hmm But
F	3066.08-3066.55	 Yeah I know him
C	3067.27-3067.4	 Yeah
B	3067.36-3071.58	 But since we all probably are pretty sure that um the
B	3072.15-3072.67	 For example
B	3073.15-3079.1	 this the dialogue history is is um producing XML documents three of course is XML
B	3079.45-3089.21	 And the ontology that um uh the student is is constructing for me back in in EML is in OIL and that also in XML
B	3089.66-3095.29	 And so that where a lot of knowledge about bakeries about hotels about castles and stuff is gonna come from
C	3093.25-3093.84	 Mm hmm
C	3094.79-3095.0	 Yeah
B	3095.87-3102.14	 Um so if it has that IO capability and if it a Java package it will definitely be able We can couple
C	3100.8-3100.87	 Yeah
C	3101.29-3104.3	 So yeah we're sort of committed to XML as the kind of
C	3104.7-3105.83	 uh interchange
C	3106.3-3108.15	 But that you know not a big deal
B	3107.68-3108.39	 Who isn't nuh
C	3108.58-3114.08	 So in terms of of interchanging in and out of any module we build
C	3114.98-3115.66	 It'll be XML
C	3115.85-3120.51	 And if you're going off to queries to the ontology for example you'll have to deal with its interface
C	3122.07-3124.75	 But that that fine and um
C	3125.36-3127.84	 all of these things have been built
C	3130.28-3132.75	 much bigger projects than this in mind So they they
C	3133.12-3139.9	 have worked very hard It kind of blackboards and multi wave blackboards and ways of interchanging and registering your And so forth
C	3140.23-3140.59	 So
C	3142.66-3145.87	 that I don't think is even worth us worrying about just yet
C	3146.74-3149.4	 I mean if we can get the core of the thing to work
C	3151.06-3152.51	 in a way that we're comfortable with
C	3153.02-3156.65	 then we we can get in and out of it with uh XML
C	3157.63-3159.98	 um little descriptors
C	3160.6-3162.09	 I believe I don't I don't see
B	3161.22-3161.7	 Hmm Yeah
B	3161.99-3164.28	 Yeah I like for example the what you said about the
B	3164.91-3170.86	 getting input from from just files about where you where you have the data have specified the features and so forth
B	3171.25-3174.26	 That of course easy also to do with you know XML
C	3173.68-3176.58	 Uh you could have an yeah you could make and XML format for that Sure
C	3177.96-3178.53	 That that
B	3178.0-3178.26	 So
C	3179.37-3180.66	 um
C	3181.04-3182.86	 you know feature value XML format
C	3182.86-3184.61	 is probably as good a way as any
C	3186.7-3188.63	 So it Yeah I guess it also worth
C	3189.35-3193.12	 um while you're poking around poke around for XML packages that
C	3193.59-3194.51	 um
C	3194.7-3195.53	 do things you'd like
F	3196.32-3198.31	 Doesn't does system have such packages
B	3198.42-3198.59	 Yeah
C	3198.48-3198.82	 Sure
B	3199.0-3201.39	 The the three library does that
B	3201.46-3202.72	 It also
C	3201.81-3203.4	 And the question is you you you'll have to
C	3203.5-3204.16	 We'll have to
C	3204.21-3206.87	 That should be We should be able to look at that
B	3207.04-3209.44	 No the
B	3210.67-3214.28	 What I What sort of came to my mind is was the notion of an idea that
C	3213.68-3214.22	 Yeah
B	3214.79-3219.74	 if if there are nets that can actually try to set their own um
B	3221.08-3224.41	 probability factors based on on on on input
B	3224.67-3225.74	 which is in file format
B	3225.83-3227.58	 if we
B	3227.88-3235.94	 um get really wild on this we may actually want to use some some corpora that other people made and for example if if they are in in MATE
B	3236.47-3242.78	 then we get L documents with discourse annotations you know from the discourse act down to the phonetic level
F	3240.04-3240.85	 Mm hmm
B	3243.38-3248.03	 Um Michael has a project where you know recognizing discourse acts and he does it all in MATE and so
B	3248.29-3250.62	 they're actually annotating data and data and data
B	3250.66-3251.22	 So if we
B	3251.67-3254.07	 if we think it worth it one of these days
B	3254.28-3261.82	 not not with this first prototype but maybe with a second and we have the possibility of of taking input that generated elsewhere and learn from that
F	3257.61-3257.95	 Right
B	3262.5-3263.48	 that'd be nice
C	3263.07-3265.6	 It'd be nice but but I I I I don't wanna count on it
C	3266.35-3269.89	 I mean you can't you can't run your project based on the speculation that
B	3269.51-3271.55	 No no uh just for
C	3270.12-3273.52	 that the data will come and you don't have to actually design the nets
B	3274.65-3276.58	 Nuh Just a back door that
B	3276.69-3278.5	 I I think we should devote
C	3277.25-3281.09	 Could happen Yeah So in terms of of the um
C	3281.09-3286.79	 the what the gives us for three packages it could be that they're fine or it could be eeh You don't
C	3286.75-3287.9	 You know you don't really like it
C	3288.48-3291.39	 So we're not we're not we're not required to use
C	3291.84-3296.82	 their packages We are required at the end to give them stuff in their format but hey
F	3297.57-3297.73	 Right
C	3298.46-3300.18	 Um
C	3300.02-3301.33	 it uh
C	3302.58-3304.55	 It doesn't control what you do you know internally
E	3315.08-3317.5	 What the time frame for this
B	3317.7-3318.14	 Two days
C	3319.08-3319.38	 Huh
B	3319.51-3320.26	 Two three days
C	3320.32-3323.79	 Yeah I'd like that this yeah this week to to to
C	3323.83-3326.35	 have guys uh you know pick
C	3327.49-3334.03	 the you know belief net package and tell us what it is and give us a pointer so we can play with it or something
B	3329.32-3329.56	 No
F	3333.85-3334.07	 Sure
C	3334.76-3337.06	 And then as soon as we have it
C	3337.65-3338.8	 I think we should start
C	3339.51-3340.99	 trying to
C	3341.58-3343.07	 populate it for this problem
C	3343.55-3345.7	 Make a first cut at you know what going on
C	3346.31-3347.25	 and probably the
C	3348.05-3349.51	 easiest way to do that
C	3352.54-3357.04	 some on line way I mean you can figure out whether you wanna make it a web site or You know
B	3356.85-3358.68	 Uh I I I um OK I
B	3359.01-3364.7	 Yeah I was actually more joking With the two or three days So this was was a usual
C	3362.01-3362.65	 OK I wasn't
B	3364.77-3369.75	 Um it will take as long as you guys need for that But um
C	3365.15-3365.38	 Yeah
C	3367.61-3368.84	 Right
B	3370.28-3380.27	 maybe it might be interesting if if the two of you can agree on who gonna be the speaker next Monday to tell us something about the net you picked and what it does and how it does that
C	3379.77-3381.81	 Well Well or both of them speak We don't care
F	3380.77-3381.09	 Sure
B	3381.83-3383.25	 Yeah or you can split it up
B	3383.78-3384.4	 So
F	3384.05-3384.34	 Hmm
B	3384.53-3387.73	 So that will be sort of the assignment for next week is to
B	3388.24-3393.82	 to for slides and whatever net you picked and what it can do and and how far you've gotten Pppt
C	3393.8-3395.19	 Well I'd like to also
C	3395.48-3398.87	 though uh have a first cut at what the
C	3399.34-3400.34	 belief net looks like
C	3400.93-3402.27	 Even if it really crude
C	3403.0-3404.01	 OK So you know
C	3404.3-3405.72	 here here are
E	3404.51-3408.47	 So we're supposed to about features and whatnot and
C	3406.91-3407.62	 Right Yeah
F	3407.08-3407.38	 Mm hmm
C	3410.27-3413.43	 And as I said what I'd like to do is
C	3413.43-3417.26	 I mean what would be really great is you bring it in If if if we could
C	3417.55-3422.29	 uh in the meeting say you know Here the package here the current one we have
C	3422.29-3425.91	 uh you know What other ideas do you have
C	3426.73-3431.44	 and then we can think about this idea of making up the data file
C	3432.43-3432.87	 Of
C	3433.31-3438.04	 uh you know get a a tentative format for it let say XML that says you know These are
C	3439.07-3441.78	 the various scenarios we've experienced
C	3441.95-3443.87	 We can just add to that and there'll be this
C	3444.02-3445.44	 this file of them and when you
C	3445.8-3447.29	 think you've got a better belief net
C	3448.49-3451.45	 You just run it against this um
C	3452.41-3453.07	 this data file
F	3454.54-3455.96	 So we'll be like hand uh
F	3456.73-3457.84	 doing all the probabilities
F	3458.61-3458.91	 OK
C	3458.7-3460.0	 Oh yeah until we know more
E	3463.53-3465.61	 And what the relation to this with
E	3466.04-3468.96	 Changing the table so that the system works in English
B	3467.73-3469.94	 OK So this is
B	3470.0-3471.39	 Whi while you were doing this
B	3471.83-3477.06	 I received two lovely emails The the full NT and the full Linux version are
B	3477.68-3478.03	 there
B	3478.73-3480.2	 I've downloaded them both
B	3481.1-3484.19	 and I started to unpack the Linux one
B	3484.2-3490.49	 Uh the NT one worked fine and I started pack the Linux one it told me that I can't really unpack it because it contains a future date
B	3490.86-3497.26	 So this is the time difference between Germany I had to wait until one o clock this afternoon before I was able to unpack it
B	3497.26-3498.33	 Now um
B	3498.35-3503.26	 Then it will be my job to get this whole thing running both on Swede and on this machine
B	3504.59-3506.57	 And so that we have it
B	3506.8-3508.75	 And then um
B	3511.08-3517.55	 Hopefully that hoping that my urgent message will now come through to Ralph and Tilman that it will send some more documentation along
B	3518.26-3519.88	 we I control
B	3520.12-3523.83	 Maybe that what I will do next Monday is show the state and show the system and show
C	3523.4-3523.65	 Yeah
B	3524.44-3524.65	 that
C	3525.1-3527.81	 Yeah So the answer Johno is that these are
C	3529.19-3529.92	 at the moment
C	3530.72-3531.23	 separate
C	3532.2-3535.22	 Uh what one hopes is that
C	3535.87-3539.4	 when we understand how the analyzer works we can both
C	3539.87-3546.42	 worry about converting it to English and worry about how it could extract the parameters we need for the belief net
E	3546.4-3550.74	 I guess my question was more about time frame So we're gonna do belief nets this week and then
C	3550.92-3553.68	 Oh yeah I don't know None of this is
C	3554.26-3555.76	 Neither of these projects
C	3556.3-3560.8	 has got a real tight time line in the sense that over the next month there a there a deliverable
E	3561.35-3561.56	 OK
C	3561.94-3565.27	 OK so uh it in that sense it opportunistic
C	3565.74-3571.26	 If if you know if we don't get any information for these guys for several weeks then we aren't gonna sit around
C	3572.04-3573.27	 you know wasting time
C	3573.46-3575.52	 trying to do the problem or guess what they
C	3575.56-3577.51	 You know just pppt go on and do other things
E	3579.17-3579.33	 OK
B	3580.34-3582.76	 Yeah but uh but the uh
B	3582.87-3587.77	 This point is really I think very very valid that ultimately we hope that
B	3587.87-3592.57	 that both will merge into a harmonious and um wonderful
B	3593.19-3595.04	 um state where
B	3595.69-3602.22	 we can not only do the bare necessities IE changing the table so it does exactly in English what it does in German
B	3602.63-3607.55	 but also that we can sort of have the system where we can say OK this is what it usually does
B	3607.88-3610.15	 and now we add this little thing to it
B	3610.39-3614.19	 you know whatever Johno and Bhaskara great belief net
B	3614.26-3615.45	 and we plug it in
B	3615.77-3617.47	 and then for these certain tasks
B	3617.47-3621.79	 and we know that navigational tasks are gonna be a core domain of the new system
B	3622.13-3623.94	 it all all of a sudden it does much better
B	3624.35-3625.15	 Nuh Because it can
B	3626.35-3627.53	 produce better answers
B	3627.65-3629.64	 tell the person as I showed you on this map
B	3630.15-3637.71	 you know produce either you know a red line that goes to the Vista point or a red line that goes to the Tango point or red line that goes to the door
B	3638.35-3639.04	 which would be great
B	3640.29-3645.22	 So not only can you show that you know something sensible but ultimately if you produce a system like this it
B	3646.08-3647.46	 takes the person where it wants to go
B	3648.51-3649.92	 Rather than taking him
B	3651.06-3654.12	 always to the geometric center of a building which is what they do now
F	3652.24-3653.3	 Mmm
B	3656.59-3658.28	 And we even had to take out a bit
B	3658.34-3659.36	 Nancy you missed that part
B	3659.79-3661.26	 We had to take out a bit of the road
B	3661.81-3664.98	 work So that it doesn't take you to the wall
B	3665.02-3668.7	 every time So Um
D	3665.93-3666.9	 Oh really
B	3670.88-3673.41	 So this was actually an actual problem that we encountered
B	3673.66-3675.03	 which nobody have has
B	3675.26-3677.73	 because car navigation systems don't really care
B	3677.89-3681.79	 You know they get you to the beginning of the street some now do the house number
D	3680.31-3681.08	 Hmm
D	3682.6-3683.3	 Mm hmm
B	3682.73-3684.95	 But even that is problematic If you go
B	3685.19-3687.3	 If you wanna drive to the SAP in Waldorf
B	3687.52-3689.1	 I'm sure the same is true of Microsoft
B	3689.15-3690.65	 it takes you to the
B	3690.77-3693.61	 the address whatever street number blah blah blah
B	3694.17-3696.29	 you are miles away from the entrance
C	3696.44-3696.63	 Yep
B	3697.01-3700.77	 Because the postal address is maybe a mailbox somewhere
D	3701.05-3701.49	 Mm hmm
B	3701.51-3704.55	 Nuh but the entrance where you actually wanna go is somewhere completely different
B	3706.68-3708.8	 So unless you're a mail person you really don't wanna go there
D	3708.98-3710.0	 Right yeah
C	3711.24-3713.62	 Probably not then cuz you probably can't drop the mail there anyway
B	3714.04-3715.46	 Probably neither not even that
C	3714.64-3714.86	 Yeah
C	3723.33-3723.55	 Clear
F	3723.86-3725.29	 OK Sounds good
E	3732.8-3734.95	 The Powder Tower is made of red limestone
D	3735.91-3738.54	 I was wondering OK
B	3737.29-3738.15	 Do you wanna see a picture
D	3738.68-3739.42	 Sure
E	3738.82-3739.15	 Sure
B	3740.34-3741.4	 Have to reboot for that though
D	3740.77-3741.14	 Um
D	3742.17-3747.98	 So you two who'll be working on this are are you will you be doing Well I mean are you supposed to just do it by
D	3749.26-3751.59	 thinking about the situation Can you use the sample data
D	3751.79-3754.72	 Is it like Yeah I mean is there more than
C	3752.0-3753.08	 Of course they use the sample data
D	3755.03-3756.5	 Is there a lot of sample data that
D	3756.83-3759.18	 is beyond what you what you have there
B	3756.94-3765.48	 There there more than I showed but um um I think this is sort of um in part my job to look at that and and to see whether
B	3766.04-3770.34	 there are features in there that can be extracted and to come up with some
D	3767.2-3767.56	 Yeah
D	3768.46-3768.75	 Right
B	3770.94-3772.28	 features that are not
B	3772.81-3780.45	 you know empirically based on on a real experiment or on on on reality but sort of on your intuition of you know Aha
D	3774.14-3774.56	 Mm hmm
F	3780.71-3781.64	 Mm hmm
D	3781.09-3781.62	 Mm hmm
B	3781.14-3784.75	 This is maybe a sign for that and this is maybe a sign for this
D	3784.24-3784.61	 Mm hmm
E	3789.2-3790.07	 Mm hmm
F	3791.57-3794.11	 So yeah Later this week we should sort of get together and sort of
B	3794.8-3796.06	 Talk features
F	3794.99-3796.26	 start thinking about that hopefully
B	3797.59-3797.7	 Yep
C	3802.4-3808.78	 OK We can end the meeting and call Adam and then we wanna look at some filthy pictures of Heidelberg
C	3809.68-3811.5	 We can do that as well
C	3812.13-3812.67	 Uh is that OK
B	3812.19-3816.05	 Well they had they used the ammunition They stored the ammunition in that tower
C	3816.6-3817.15	 Alright
B	3816.83-3821.3	 And that why when it was hit by uh a cannon ball it exploded
C	3820.49-3915.95	 Oh Ni
E	3820.52-3821.15	 It exploded
E	3825.46-3826.93	 That why they call it the Powder Tower
B	3827.31-3827.99	 Ahh
E	3827.5-3827.88	 OK
E	3828.42-3833.15	 I first thought it had something to do with the material that it that why I asked
D	3832.98-3833.86	 That right OK
B	3880.27-3880.93	 Mmm
