*A:	So, anyway, how are you doing these days? 145150_147510
*B:	Things are going very well.
*B:	I think I had mentioned before that, um, that uh, that uh, that
	there's a company now that I'm working with . 147700_154910
*B:	um, uh, which is very much just, just myself and Guss. 155500_158710
*A:	oh. 159660_159910
*B:	And that &um . 159661_160740
*A:	No, you hadn't mentioned that. 161030_162050
*B:	eh, oh, okay.
*B:	okay, so &um . 161370_163630
*A:	eh you told me that you were leaving the company that you were at,
	and you were entertaining offers.
*A:	And, &uh . 163100_169250
*B:	Well i-, well it seemed to make sense since I had a client to, to
	just kind of set up my own company, of sorts.
*B:	So &um . 170130_176440
*A:	oh. 175710_176000
*B:	So things are going extremely well.
*B:	So, I had one client who said that he'd pay me a minimum amount.
*B:	You know, he'd, he, uh, there would be a minimum amount of work, of
	about uh, a day a week for the next two three years. 176520_188560
*A:	mhm. 188940_189300
*B:	Which is sufficient to pay all my bills then so I decided that it
	would make sense to do this.
*B:	And, &um . 188941_193930
*B:	and, um, I've been getting substantially more work than then. 194560_197690
*A:	mm. 197940_198300
*B:	So I'm quite pleased, quite pleased. 198970_200830
*A:	Well that's good. 201100_201870
*B:	So, um, so I have a bunch of &uh work that I need to do on my flat
	this year.
*B:	I've been telling you that I needed to do that roof atrium for
	quite some time.
*B:	But, it should, uh, it should come out this year. 202310_214010
*A:	oh, well that's good. 214260_215390
*B:	It should be done in a few months. 215390_216690
*A:	oh, yeah I remember . 217080_218300
*B:	&=lipsmack So . 217210_218090
*A:	you talking a little bit about it at one point. 218650_220950
*B:	yeah, yeah. 221060_221770
*B:	So you have no intentions of coming over this way any time soon? 222540_225420
*A:	um.
*A:	I don't see the finances occurring . 226010_229290
*B:	uhhuh, right. 229480_230100
*A:	for a while. 229600_230250
*A:	um, actually right at the moment finances are not going real well.
*A:	But . 231040_234760
*B:	ah well. 235250_235640
*A:	I am working on that one. 235270_236400
*A:	uh. 236980_237360
*A:	&=inhales It's just . 237900_238550
*B:	But &um . 238070_238670
*A:	uh, uh, the the the main reason for that is I had not really
	anticipated a few expenses that recently came up . 239130_246640
*B:	ah. 246990_247620
*A:	uh, related to a couple of burglaries that I had. 247010_250770
*B:	oh, harsh.
*B:	Harsh. 251130_252630
*A:	yeah.
*A:	yeah, but, and. 252280_255060
*A:	Not a whole lot I can do about that now. 255770_257400
*B:	Indeed.
*B:	Indeed. 257859_259010
*A:	have to deal with the situation.
*A:	And . 258709_260380
*A:	So that's what I'm doing. 261200_262160
*B:	Sounds good. 262750_263560
*A:	But &um . 262980_263610
*A:	Anyway, &uh . 265050_266030
*A:	One of the main reasons that I've been such a pathetic, uh,
	correspondent has been work. 266930_272760
*A:	I've actually been doing a_lot_of it. 273320_275390
*B:	oh wow. 276020_276620
*A:	And uh, I turned in my Master's thesis back in May, and I'm
	actually presently working on, um, . 276080_284320
*A:	several, uh, articles . 284800_286660
*B:	oh, okay.
*B:	Impressive xxx &=distortion. 287550_289210
*A:	from it. 288890_289100
*A:	yeah, actually it turns out that one thing, one little . 289920_293590
*A:	bit in what I was doing, uh, is going to turn out to be very
	important in the end. 294700_299340
*A:	And, uh, . 300090_300870
*A:	from what I had been reading in the literature.
*A:	You see the one very annoying thing about all of this, was my
	advisor has been in France for a year and a half. 302000_308810
*B:	yeah. 309270_309620
*A:	And this made writing my thesis very annoying because you know
	there wasn't much discussion. 309640_315270
*B:	yeah.
*B:	yup, yup. 315980_316900
*A:	But, &um . 316460_317730
*A:	Anyway, I had been . 319170_321030
*A:	kind of telling him that, you know, from my reading of the
	literature, I thought that this one little alteration I had made in
	my model was kind of clever and unique. 321890_332630
*B:	mhm. 333280_333620
*A:	And it f-, made . 333570_335450
*A:	w- the one type of solution occur, which . 336390_339840
*A:	was seen experimentally, but none of the other models had, uh, had?
	340550_345280
*B:	Yes. 345920_346510
*A:	They basically, the-, I I'm looking at, um, multi mode lasers.
*A:	And one of the . 346530_351730
*A:	things that they find experimentally are what they call anti
	phased, uh, states, where . 352240_358300
*A:	if you look at the total intensity . 359220_361240
*B:	uhhuh. 361830_362200
*A:	of the laser, you get . 361980_363520
*A:	an oscillation which is characterized by one frequency. 364090_367660
*B:	Yes.
*B:	okay. 368200_368960	
*A:	If you look, i- if you separate out the different modes of the
	laser . 369350_373450
*B:	mhm. 374140_374560
*A:	and look at one of those, you get more than one frequency. 374141_378360
*B:	okay. 379280_379680
*A:	So what's happening is that the modes are oscillating out of phase
	so that they completely mask each other's . 379400_386220
*B:	Exactly.
