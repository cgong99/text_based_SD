Speaker 0    00:01:46    I've actually been doing a lot of it.  
Speaker 1    00:02:10    Oh  
Speaker 0    00:02:11    Wow. And, uh, I turned in my master's thesis back in may and I'm actually presently working on, um, several, um, articles.  
Speaker 1    00:02:22    Oh, okay. Impressive.  
Speaker 0    00:02:24    Yeah. Actually it turns out that one thing one little bit in what I was doing, uh, is going to turn out to be very important in the end. And, uh, from what I had been reading in the literature, see the one very annoying thing about all of this was my advisor's been in France for a year and a half. Yeah. And this made writing my thesis very annoying because you know, there wasn't much discussion. Yeah. Yep. Yep. But, um, anyway, I had been kind of telling him that, you know, from my, my reading of the literature, I thought that this one little alteration I had made in my model was kind of clever and unique mm-hmm <affirmative> and it made one type of solution occur, which was seen experimentally, but none of the other models had, uh, had yes. BA basically I I'm looking at, um, multi-mode lasers. And one of the things that they find experimentally are what they call anti phased, uh, states, where if you look at the total intensity Uhhuh of the laser, you get an oscillation, which is characterized by one frequency.  
Speaker 1    00:03:43    Yes. Okay.  
Speaker 0    00:03:44    If you look, I, if you separate out the different modes of the laser mm-hmm <affirmative> and look at one of those
