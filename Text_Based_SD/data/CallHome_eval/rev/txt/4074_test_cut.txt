Speaker 0    00:00:00    So anyway, how are you doing these days?  
Speaker 1    00:00:02    Things are going very well. I think I had mentioned before that, um, that, uh, that, uh, that there's a company now that I'm working with, um, uh, which is very much just, just myself and Chris and that, um, no, you hadn't mentioned that. Oh, okay. Okay. So, um,  
Speaker 0    00:00:18    And you told me that you were leaving the company that you were at and you were entertaining offers and, uh,  
Speaker 1    00:00:24    Well, well, it seemed to make sense since I had a client to, to just kind of set up my own company of sorts. So, um, some things are going extremely well. So I had one client who said that he'd pay me a minimum amount, you know, he'd, he, uh, there'd be a minimum amount of work of about a, a day a week for the next two, three years, which is sufficient to pay all my bills. And so I decided that it would make sense to do this. And, um, and, um, I've been getting substantially more work on that. So I'm quite pleased, quite pleased.  
Speaker 0    00:00:55    Well, that's  
Speaker 1    00:00:56    Good. So, um, so I have a bunch of, uh, work that I need to do on my flat this year. I've been telling you that I needed to do that roof atrium for quite some time, but it should, uh, it should come out this year. Oh, well, that's good. It should be done in a few months.  
Speaker 0    00:01:11    Oh yeah. I remember you talking a little bit about it at one point. Yeah.  
Speaker 1    00:01:16    Yep. So you have no intentions of coming over this way anytime soon.  
Speaker 0    00:01:21    Um, I don't see the finances occurring no, for a while. Um, actually right at the moment, finances are not going real well, but oh wow. I'm working on that one. Uh, it's just, uh, the, the main reason for that is I had not really anticipated a few expenses that recently came up, uh, related to a couple of burglaries that I had.  
Speaker 1    00:01:46    Oh,  
Speaker 0    00:01:46    Harsh. Harsh. Yeah. Yeah. But yeah, not a whole lot. I can do about that now. Indeed, indeed. To deal with the situation. And so that's what I'm doing, but, um, anyway, uh, one of the main reasons that I've been such a pathetic, uh, correspondence has been work, I've actually been doing a lot of it.  
Speaker 1    00:02:10    Oh  
Speaker 0    00:02:11    Wow. And, uh, I turned in my master's thesis back in may and I'm actually presently working on, um, several, um, articles.  
Speaker 1    00:02:22    Oh, okay. Impressive.  
Speaker 0    00:02:24    Yeah. Actually it turns out that one thing one little bit in what I was doing, uh, is going to turn out to be very important in the end. And, uh, from what I had been reading in the literature, see the one very annoying thing about all of this was my advisor's been in France for a year and a half. Yeah. And this made writing my thesis very annoying because you know, there wasn't much discussion. Yeah. Yep. Yep. But, um, anyway, I had been kind of telling him that, you know, from my, my reading of the literature, I thought that this one little alteration I had made in my model was kind of clever and unique mm-hmm <affirmative> and it made one type of solution occur, which was seen experimentally, but none of the other models had, uh, had yes. BA basically I I'm looking at, um, multi-mode lasers. And one of the things that they find experimentally are what they call anti phased, uh, states, where if you look at the total intensity Uhhuh of the laser, you get an oscillation, which is characterized by one frequency.  
Speaker 1    00:03:43    Yes. Okay.  
Speaker 0    00:03:44    If you look, I, if you separate out the different modes of the laser mm-hmm <affirmative> and look at one of those, you get more than one frequency. Okay. So what's happening is that the modes are oscillating out of phase so that they completely mask each other's  
Speaker 1    00:04:01    Exactly
