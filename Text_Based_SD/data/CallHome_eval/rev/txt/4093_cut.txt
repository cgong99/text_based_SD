Speaker 0    00:00:00    But, uh, yeah, it's still, it's still fairly, it's still a fairly expensive call, but, uh, but it's a lot less expensive if we do it that way than if we, than if we actually make my, my, my parents-in-law pay it. Then it, the Dutch have such high taxes on those, they consider it a luxury to call around the world, so they tax it really high Anyway. Um, so you guys will be in either the 18th or the 19th and you're gonna go to, uh, Amsterdam. What I would say is once you're at a hotel mm-hmm. <affirmative>, um, why don't you call me at work and let me know where you are and then we can make arrangements that day. Um, that I can meet you in Amsterdam and maybe I'll come by public transport. So it's probably easier for me to come by public transport and Amsterdam than it is for me to come by car, to be honest.  
Speaker 0    00:00:49    Mm-hmm. <affirmative>, the streets are small and there's no parking, so I probably will come by public transport, but I don't know. We'll see where you're staying. Um, and there's a lot more for you guys if you want to see stuff. You can see stuff in Amsterdam and, uh, since the days are really long, I mean, it stays light here till about 10 30, 11 o'clock mm-hmm. <affirmative> at night. So if you want, we can, we can take a ride and go see stuff at night and I can take you to some places we can go see, uh, go see some stuff, um, depends on what you guys want to see. So you guys should pick out the things you want to see and let me know. Um, and I'll, I'll sit and talk with ane about some things that maybe we think they'd be for you to see. So if you don't have any ideas, we'll put something together for you. Okay. Um, but yeah, but I can pick you up, You know, I'll probably be there sometime around six and we can like, do do a quick dinner or something and then go, uh, and then go Yeah, go see whatever you wanna see. Do you wanna stay in Amsterdam? That's fine. If you want to go, uh, off into the countryside somewhere and see a little bit of the Holland. Real Holland. And we can do that too.  
Speaker 1    00:01:56    Actually, I, I've been up to Holland before, it's been about two weeks  
Speaker 0    00:01:59    There. Yeah.  
Speaker 1    00:02:00    So, um, but that was years and years ago  
Speaker 0    00:02:03    With your parents when your father was stationed over here, right?  
Speaker 1    00:02:06    Yeah. But we, we gotta see Den Hog and places like that too, which we're obviously not gonna see this time, but, um, Has Kim been here before? No.  
Speaker 0    00:02:20    Okay.  
Speaker 1    00:02:22    But then again, I'm, I'm not sure that Kim would be interested in seeing Shape headquarters and, you know, all that kind of stuff.  
Speaker 0    00:02:29    <laugh>, it's  
Speaker 1    00:02:31    A military thing.  
Speaker 0    00:02:34    Would you be interested in seeing, seeing Shape headquarters again?  
Speaker 1    00:02:38    No, not really. <laugh>?  
Speaker 0    00:02:41    Yeah. I didn't, I didn't think so. Somehow I had this feeling that the, that the military taste had been beaten out of you. <laugh>. Yep. I'm the mil, I can't say too bad things about the military though. They still have my goods and they'll probably hold them a hostage and they owned my body and soul for like another four years. So I just gotta play that. They, yeah. I, I owe four years in active reserve time.  
Speaker 1    00:03:05    All right, great. Do they do that to everyone? My life? Yeah.  
Speaker 0    00:03:11    Everyone who, everyone who's, uh, who hasn't been like you were, you went through like the 36 2 process mm-hmm. <affirmative>. So you don't, you don't have it, but if, yeah, if you just separate normally and you haven't served at least eight years, then you owe it.  
Speaker 1    00:03:25    And that's one of those things they just never tell you up front.  
Speaker 0    00:03:30    No, they never said anything of. I figured there was something like that because, and  
Speaker 1    00:03:34    I was, I was in the inactive reserves the entire time I was in college too. So  
Speaker 0    00:03:40    Yeah, that's, I mean that's the military. I, I have my, my discharge papers and everything Uhhuh and I, they, I've, I've said that yeah, I will give a urine sample or a blood sample if they, if they call me back for those, but they're gonna have to pay my trip back to the states cause there's no basis in Holland that I'm not gonna pay out 'em, I own expenses to go to Germany or something for them. If they want me, they can pay, bring me back to active duty and pay me for the day that they're gonna drag me off somewhere. But, uh, first they have to find me. Yeah, that's do is  
Speaker 1    00:04:13    If you're in another country, I mean, and you're not planning on coming back to the us what are you, what are they gonna do even if you don't?  
Speaker 0    00:04:20    Yeah, well, I mean, I still American citizen and I still would like to be welcome in my whole country. Although, Yeah, you, if if if they denied my citizenship and I became a citizen here, I probably wouldn't be a either. But, uh, yeah, right now I'm, I mean I do want to keep my American citizenship, so I kind of wanna citizen. What's that? Are  
Speaker 1    00:04:41    You gonna try and become a dual citizen?  
Speaker 0    00:04:43    Have dual citizen? You can't do, you can't do that. Um, the only way to be a dual citizen is if you're born in a foreign country. Like if I were born in, in, in Holland and then when, and then had American parents, then I could be a dual citizen. But you can't, if I would ask to become a citizen in Holland, I would automatically lose my American citizenship  
Speaker 1    00:05:02    As far as the Americans are concerned. Yeah.  
Speaker 0    00:05:05    Yeah. The Dutch could care less. The Dutch would say fine, wanna be adult citizen, That's fine. But the Americans, as soon as you ask for another citizenship, that act of asking for it takes away your American citizenship. It's kind of stupid.  
Speaker 1    00:05:20    Yeah.  
Speaker 0    00:05:22    So I'm a American re I'm a, I'm an expatriate an American expatriate, an American living abroad <laugh>. So I still have to file a tax return. Do you? Yeah. But my first $75,000 worth of income is tax free. Good. Good. As long as I don't bring it back to the states.  
Speaker 1    00:05:41    Good. Please. IRS for you. Huh?  
Speaker 0    00:05:45    <laugh>. Oh, they want their share. They want their piece of meat, but all foreign taxes are deductible and my taxes here are 50% of income. So the taxes here are so much higher that Yeah. I would never have to worry about it  
Speaker 1    00:06:00    <laugh>, unless you became CEO of the company then, then maybe like a thousand dollars should be taxable,  
Speaker 0    00:06:07    Right? Yeah. Some outrage is a small amount. The problem's gonna be, the problem's gonna be, uh, beyond you's. American salary is taxable here and at 50%, so we're going to owe some money to the Dutch government on her salary. Oh. Some amount that has And as we deducted a certain amount and the amount we pay the American government is deductible, but we will still owe some taxes. So I don't know how it works. We're gonna need to have some, we're gonna to have some sort of account and do it. Cause I have no clue how that all works.  
Speaker 1    00:06:38    They don't have the quick and Dutch version.  
Speaker 0    00:06:41    Yeah. <laugh>, I, you know, I wouldn't trust it because it's so complicated with this international garbage or, or off the TurboTax  
Speaker 1    00:06:50    With the, the Dutch modules.  
Speaker 0    00:06:52    Yeah. Somehow I just wouldn't trust it. I don't know. Yeah. So complicated when you're dealing with a Dutch tax form on, you had to read it on you and her father didn't understand the damn thing. How am I supposed to understand it?  
Speaker 1    00:07:04    I'm really looking forward to moving to Oregon and dealing with Oregon. You pay state tax Washington, you don't, I'm looking forward to that  
Speaker 0    00:07:11    Cause Yeah, but you'll be a, you'll be a student, so you, I mean you're, what, what is your income?  
Speaker 1    00:07:17    Oh, well see, I think, um, it'll probably be about $5,000 for the, for the portion next year that I'm in Oregon or the portion of this year that I'm in Oregon. And then next year it'll be 11,000.  
Speaker 0    00:07:29    Yeah, but you'll be below, I mean you're below the poverty line at that level. Yeah. So I mean any you come that,  
Speaker 1    00:07:38    But then I've already made say like 15,000 or whatever here in Washington. But  
Speaker 0    00:07:44    That should be non-taxable out of state income.  
Speaker 1    00:07:46    It should, but you know, it, it just, it's not gonna be a fun tax return year.  
Speaker 0    00:07:52    <laugh>, I had that when I went to the military. <laugh> I can, I had to file three tags. I had to file Georgia, Kansas, and Yeah. And then my federal. So  
Speaker 1    00:08:07    Well, um, actually I think there's phone call's just about to end cuz it's only half an hour. But, um, so let's see. I'll, I'll give you a call when we arrive in or maybe I'll just call you when we get in Holland, just to let you know we're there. So if we get in the 18th or the 19th and then call you back when, um, when we get to a hotel or something like that.  
Speaker 0    00:08:28    Okay. That's a, that's a great idea. If you, if as soon as you get into Holland and you get yourself settled, you can call me and uh, if I'm, if it's at night, just call on his parents. Okay. So, and remember if you dial in Holland, you need to add a zero. So like right now it's, it's 1 8 1 0 area code. If you dial in Holland, it's 0 1 8 1 0 in Holland. Okay. And, and then yeah, you can just call up if, if it's, if it's during, during the work hours, fine. Call me at work. If not, call on his parents if you don't have a new phone number for me. And if you do, I'll send it by email. Okay. If I get it before this weekend, I'll, we'll email you something. But if you don't get emailed and just calling his parents, if we have a phone by then they'll be able to give you the number and just remember to ask for her mother.  
Speaker 0    00:09:15    And it's B, right? B, B, B as in A B minus. B a. Okay. Great. <laugh> and Yeah. And I think, uh, it's, it's not fr it's, yeah, it's uh, it's Mara, Mara is the, uh, is in Fr and German. It's Fra. Mm-hmm <affirmative> and then Dutch, It's Mufa. Oh. Probably never remember that. So nah, don't worry about it. You can just call her misses. You can just call her misses and speaking Mr. Do she'll. She understands. Just talk slowly and clearly. Okay. And once you're in hauling, the line will be really clear. I mean the phones here are pretty good once you're in the country, it's just these over, over America to America. It's always kind of.
