spk_0:  but uh yeah it's still it's still fairly fairly expensive call but uh but it's a lot less expensive if we do it that way then if we if we actually make my my my parents in law pay it then it's the dutch have such high taxes on those They considered a luxury to call around the world So they tax it really high
spk_0:  Anyway Um so you guys will be in either the 18th or the 19th and you're gonna go to Amsterdam What I would say is once you're at a hotel um why don't you call me at work
spk_1:  and
spk_0:  let me know where you are and then we can make arrangements that day um that I can meet you in Amsterdam and maybe I'll come by public transport it's probably easier for me to come by public transport and Amsterdam than it is for me to come by car to be honest the streets are small and there's no parking so I probably will come by public transport but I don't know we'll see where you're staying
spk_0:  Um
spk_0:  And there's a lot more for you guys if you wanna see stuff you can see stuff in Amsterdam and uh since the days are really long I mean it stays light here until about 10 30 11 o'clock at night so if you want we can we can take a ride and go see stuff at night
spk_0:  and I can take you to some places we can go see uh go see some stuff
spk_0:  um depends on what you guys wanna see so you guys pick up the things you wanna see
spk_0:  and let me know
spk_0:  Um and I'll I'll sit and talk with you about some things that maybe we think they'd be need for you to see So if you don't have any ideas we'll put something together for you Um But yeah but I can pick you up you know I'll probably be there sometime around six and we can like do do a quick dinner or something and then go uh
spk_0:  and then go yeah go see whatever you want to see if you wanna stay in Amsterdam that's fine If you wanna go uh off into the countryside somewhere and see a little bit of the holland really Holland and we can do
spk_1:  that too
spk_1:  actually I've been up to Holland before it's been about two weeks So um but that was years and years ago
spk_0:  with your parents and your father were stationed over here right
spk_1:  Yeah but we we got to see and places like that too which we're obviously not gonna see this time
spk_1:  but um
spk_1:  has
spk_0:  been here before
spk_1:  Okay
spk_1:  but then again I'm I'm not sure that would be interested in seeing shape headquarters and you know all that kind of stuff
spk_1:  military thing
spk_0:  would you be interested in seeing seeing safe headquarters again
spk_1:  No not really
spk_0:  Okay
spk_0:  Yeah I didn't I didn't think so somehow I had this feeling that the the military taste have been beaten out of you
spk_0:  I can't say too bad things about the military that they still have my goods and they'll probably hold them hostage
spk_0:  and I own my body and soul for like another four years So I just gotta pray
spk_0:  Yeah I have I owe four years inactive reserve time
spk_1:  Alright great Do they do that to everyone
spk_0:  Yeah Everyone who
spk_0:  Everyone who is uh who hasn't been like you you went through like the 36th process So you don't you don't have it But if yeah if you just separate normally and you haven't served at least eight years then you owe
spk_1:  it
spk_1:  And that's one of those things they just never tell you up front
spk_0:  No they never said anything I figured there was something like that because
spk_1:  I was in the inactive reserves the entire time I was in college too
spk_1:  So
spk_0:  yeah that's I mean that's the military I I have my my discharge papers and everything And I've said that yeah I will give a urine sample of blood
spk_1:  sample if they if they
spk_0:  call me back for those but they're gonna have to pay my trip back
spk_1:  to the States
spk_0:  because there's no basis in Holland and I'm not gonna pay out of my own expenses to go to Germany or something for them
spk_0:  If they want me they can bring me back active duty and pay me for today
spk_1:  that
spk_0:  they're gonna drag me off somewhere
spk_0:  But uh first I have to find me
spk_1:  Yeah
spk_0:  that's what I'm
spk_1:  gonna do is if you're in another country I mean you're not planning on coming back to the us what what are they gonna do Even if you don't
spk_0:  Yeah well I mean I still american citizen and I still would like to be welcoming country Although yeah you know if if if they denied my citizenship and I became a citizen here I probably wouldn't be a horror either But uh yeah right now I mean I do want to keep my american
spk_1:  citizenship so
spk_0:  I kinda wanna
spk_1:  citizen
spk_1:  What's that Are you gonna try and become a dual citizen
spk_0:  You can't do you can't do that Um The only way to be a dual citizen is if you're born in a foreign country like if I were born in in in Holland and then and then had american parents then I could be a dual citizen But you can't if I would ask to become a citizen in Holland I would automatically lose my american citizenship
spk_1:  as far as the americans are concerned Yeah
spk_0:  Yeah that's good but that should say fine one of the adult citizen that's fine but the americans as soon as you ask for another citizenship that active asking for it takes away your american citizenship
spk_0:  It's kind of stupid
spk_0:  So I'm a american I'm an ex patriot an american ex patriot an american living abroad
spk_0:  I still have to file a tax return Yeah but my 1st $75,000 worth of income is tax free
spk_1:  As
spk_0:  long as I don't bring it back to the States
spk_1:  Oh they want
spk_0:  Their share they want their piece of meat but all foreign taxes are deductible And my taxes here are 50
spk_1:  percent of income
spk_0:  So the taxes here are so much higher That yeah I would never have to worry about it
spk_1:  Unless you became ceo of the company Then then maybe like
spk_0:  1000
spk_1:  dollars should be taxable right
spk_0:  Small amount
spk_0:  The problem is going to be the problem is gonna be uh beyond American salary is taxable here and at 50% So we're going to owe some money to the Dutch government on her salary
spk_0:  Some amount that has as we deducted a certain amount and the amount we pay the american government is deductible but it will still owe some taxes I don't know how it works We're gonna need we're gonna need some sort of accountant do it because I have no clue
spk_0:  how that all works
spk_1:  They don't have the quick and dead version
spk_1:  Yeah
spk_1:  I
spk_0:  you know I wouldn't trust it because it's so complicated with this international garbage or or else the turbo tax
spk_1:  with the dutch modules
spk_0:  Yeah somehow I just wouldn't trust it I don't know complicated when you're dealing with the dutch tax form and you had to read it an onion or Father didn't understand the damn thing How am I supposed to understand it
spk_1:  I'm really looking forward to moving to Oregon and dealing with Oregon You pay state tax Washington's you don't I'm looking forward to that
spk_0:  you'll be you'll be a student So you I mean you're what what is your income
spk_1:  Oh well
spk_1:  See I think um it'll probably be about $5,000 for the for the portion next year that I'm in Oregon or the portion of this year that I'm in Oregon and then next year it will be 11,000
spk_0:  Yeah but you'll be below
spk_1:  I
spk_0:  mean you're below the poverty line at that level So I mean any income that
spk_1:  But then I've already made say like 15,000 or whatever here in Washington's but
spk_1:  that
spk_0:  should be non taxable out of state income
spk_1:  It should but you know it it just it's not gonna be a fun tax return here
spk_0:  I had that when I went to the military
spk_0:  I can't I have to file three tax I had to file Georgia Kansas And yeah and then my Federal
spk_0:  so
spk_1:  well um actually I think these phone calls just about the end because it's only half an hour But um
spk_1:  so let's see I'll give you a call
spk_1:  When we arrive in or maybe I'll just call you when we get in Holland just to let you know we're there So if we get on the 18th or the 19th and then call you back when um when we get to the hotel or something like that
spk_0:  Okay that's a that's a great idea as soon as you get into Holland and you get yourself settled
spk_0:  You can call me and uh if if it's at night just call on his parents and remember if you dial in Holland you need to add a zero So like right now it's it's 1810 area code If you dial in Holland it's 01810
spk_0:  in Holland
spk_0:  And and then yeah you can just call up if if it's if it's during the work hours fine call me at work if not call on his parents if you don't have a new phone number for me And if you do I'll send it by email If I get it before this weekend uh we'll email you something but if you don't get email and just calling his parents if we have a phone by then they'll be able to give you the number and just remember to ask for her mother
spk_1:  and its blued right bode
spk_0:  boat as an abode minus the a
spk_1:  great
spk_1:  Yeah
spk_0:  And yeah and I think uh it's it's not
spk_0:  morale morale is the uh
spk_0:  frau and german
spk_1:  I'll probably never remember that So
spk_0:  don't worry about it You can just call her Mrs you can just call her Mrs speaking She understands just talks slowly and clearly
spk_1:  okay
spk_0:  and once you're in Holland the line will be really clear I mean the phones here are pretty good Once you're in the country it's just over over America America is always kind of Iffy
