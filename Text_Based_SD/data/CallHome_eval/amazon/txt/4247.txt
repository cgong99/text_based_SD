spk_0:  great what should we talk about
spk_1:  Well I don't know tell me what's going on in America I haven't seen the news needs is
spk_0:  really
spk_1:  an american and I know what's going on a rush of us
spk_0:  Yeah well let's see what's going on Uh Do you want me to just give you some headlines
spk_0:  Yeah I was just gonna say Clinton just came out yesterday with his uh his statement concerning affirmative action
spk_0:  And basically he has in the past said that he was not in favor of uh
spk_0:  you know of making um allowances strictly based on race but at the same time the analysis in the news shall we say the conservative analysis in the news is that clinton just came out and said that he doesn't believe in quota systems and in reverse discrimination but that he does believe that affirmative action is necessary to move
spk_0:  black americans forward and to give them the opportunities that they've been denied So he's trying to kind of walking a tight rope You know what I'm saying In other words
spk_1:  Everybody
spk_0:  let's see if we can make everybody happy I
spk_1:  think
spk_0:  I think you're right
spk_0:  because you know Affirmative action is really under attack in the United States from many different quarters right And it's a big it's a big issue because it's supposed to be a gender I mean not a gender a race color blind we're supposed to be race color blind And yet it's like contractors that are bidding you know with the high bid or higher than the lowest bid are still getting the contracts only because they are of ethnic protected you know black or whatever
spk_0:  And it's really and then they're taking lawsuits to the Supreme Court and all this So it's
spk_1:  another
spk_0:  thing that just came up was that the Supreme Court said that the redistricting of the congressional districts one of which is in Georgia violated the constitution because it was based primarily on race
spk_0:  There was
spk_1:  they were doing it because they were trying to make it for like they were trying to make it less segregated
spk_0:  they were trying to make the district majority black americans So therefore they drew it all the way across the state You see what I'm saying a very narrow district and it created a majority black district which then elected
spk_0:  a black representative and then it was challenged because it said well the only reason that has been done this way just to ensure that it was majority black and that's not
spk_0:  you know
spk_0:  Hello
spk_1:  I'm
spk_0:  here I'm
spk_1:  following all this over That's interesting because today we had a discussion with students about because we're doing a pre departure orientation So we had a hot topic discussion today where we break in small groups and we talked about political correctness racial prejudice and harassment just like different topics that they might encounter in America where the people different attitudes So that was one of the things
spk_1:  but I have the attitude is in America
spk_0:  where there's a lot of frustration I think over the fact that there there are a number of evidence is that the affirmative Action Program is in fact discriminating in the other direction And people are saying wait a minute why don't we just give every
spk_0:  everybody try to give everybody an equal shot and if someone feels that they've been discriminated against because of their race go at it from the standpoint of trying to remedy it through the courts rather than saying that government has to give x number of contracts to minority no matter what
spk_0:  And as a result some uh some people are getting contracts just because of the color of their skin And you know what I'm saying it's it's either that they're not even they're not the low bid you know normally on contracts you take the low bid that meets the quality spec specifications
spk_1:  right
spk_0:  And but now you there have been several cases where clearly you know it was they didn't get it because they just didn't want the right color skin So now is that is that really remitting the situation or is it just creating a lot of resentment
spk_0:  and it's kind of too bad Oh it's a mess It really is How long have you been there by the way
spk_1:  over here Um it'll be three years in november
spk_0:  wow so you really are out of touch aren't you
spk_1:  I like to think I'm not totally honest
spk_0:  Well I know I was never
spk_1:  very in touch even when I was still in America
spk_0:  Oh okay you're that type I got you
spk_1:  in my own world anyways
spk_0:  Well I know what it's like because I having lived over in Korea for almost three years um it's you know when you come back all of a sudden you know the society has changed a little bit you know new terminology new buzzwords and all of that stuff
spk_0:  Of course when you get to be over 40 like me you can miss that stuff just being an American anyway
spk_0:  it all passed
spk_1:  when I was in college I didn't know what was going on I was
spk_0:  thinking of lingo that the young people come up with you
spk_0:  younger people Yeah I think I'm more informed now than I was in college I was sort of out of it in college
spk_0:  but uh by the way did I tell you that I have a new job
spk_0:  Well
spk_1:  in your email you said that you're going to start your new Justin but you didn't say what your new job was
spk_0:  Okay I resigned here last week effective August 10 and I'll be taking the job of the director of English language the English language program of a private university in Atlanta a larger university
spk_0:  So it's kind of a step up for me it's called Mercer University
spk_1:  Oh you have to send this material something
spk_0:  hey now we're talking
spk_1:  to you guys to send
spk_0:  people into ESL programs
spk_1:  Well we get requests about it I don't know how many people actually go you don't have a lot of money but we get students every year that asked about it they have money and tell us whether or not they go
spk_0:  well you can be sure that we will send you information because uh
spk_0:  you know I've got to go down there and we're trying to to improve the program We're adding they're adding thousands of dollars of state of the art language you know equipment lab equipment and all of that And they're restructuring everything So
spk_0:  that's what I'm supposed to do next

spk_1:  they have any scholarships for foreign students
spk_0:  I I I've never heard of a scholarship for an english language program personally But I
spk_1:  think
spk_0:  yeah I know I'm sure that they probably you know the question of whether they have scholarships for international students um for the regular programme is a good one And I'd like to find out I'd like to think that they do and I think they might but I don't know yet
spk_0:  it's not going to be my particular area of expertise You know it's it's that's that's gonna be a regular program but still I would like to know
spk_0:  I can tell people like
